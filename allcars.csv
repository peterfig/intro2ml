But what they do is search a database of owners to vins (maintained from state vehicle registration), and send letters out to the people owning cars with VIN numbers that are affected.


The reason the dealership told you that you are good to go is that they simply searched ford's database of affected vehicles and your VIN # didn't come up meaning that your car was likely built after the problem was fixed in manufacturing.  Or all those fuel pumps came from a bad batch and they know which cars that batch ended up in because they keep track of all that data when they build your car.


edit: an example is that I had BMW run my vin for me and then print out a list of part names and numbers.  All of them for every part of my car.  My car was built at an odd time between model years (it was a special order the PO did) and has a bunch of weird parts combinations in it (I got the hydraulic belt tensioners but retained the older higher boost luk LF-30 power steering pump.  The cars built my model year saw the hydraulic tensionsers and the LF-20, the year before it the LF-30 and mechanical tensioners).

As for gas engines.... you're gonna average around 12-15 in the city, 17-20 on the highway. The raptor is worse though because of the tires. They're actually 315/70R17, which is close to a 35x12.5. They are rated at 11 city, 16 highway with the 6.2. Aerodynamics of a brick haha. That's honestly not that bad. It's about what I get in my 351w bronco. I'm sure you can help that with a tune, exhaust, and intake but it won't be much. Also the stock tires run about $250 a tire but those tires wear like steel so they'll last 50,000+ miles.

I have a leveling kit, 130 amp alternator, ghetto cold air intake, header-back 3"" exhaust with a high flow cat and dynomax VT muffler, and I took the air dam off of the front bumper because it helps the approach angle and the P.O. had cut part of it up. I'm gonna wire some aux lights and put in front tow hooks over the summer and once my tires wear out I'm going to 33s. That's about it for upgrades for now.

181,Ford,Yes it does look like we are twins. And yeah it does need an alignment. That's the first thing I am doing tomorrow after getting a tag for it. My first upgrade will most likely be headers/exhaust with CAI. Will also put a tune on it. Down the road do gt40 heads + b303 cam.,2.0
182,Ford,"Yeah the stock exhaust is very restrictive. I think I kept the sub 2000rpm torque about the same but the truck really comes to life around 2800 all the way to 4500.

As for the heads and cam, that's something that I want to do but I'm pretty sure you either have to convert to MAF or put in a quarterhorse tuner chip. The stock speed-density can only handle up to 300hp and with those mods you would be getting close to, if not surpassing the 300hp mark.

218,Ford,There are some Ford techs who have been reporting that the ecoboost is showing a problem once it gets some miles on it that Ford doesn't know how to fix at this point. Allegedly carbon is building up on the back side of the intake valves and will eventually release and go into the turbo and cause damage to it. Ford is not doing warranty repairs on this at this point. For that reason and because of turbo lag I got an '14 with a 5.0 and absolutely love it. The torque is awesome. ,3.0

Soo ecobox tuners :)  I've had a mazdaspeed3 and this cobalt ss turbo, many friends with other cars and I put a preorder in on a RS. So I like my cars to be trackable and fun on the street. 

You are correct the SS is very under rated. Magazines etc still do not give it coverage, hell Chevy barely did. The supercharged won the time attack driven by then gmpp head john h. It destroyed everything. They had to take parts off as it was too fast. I have my SS track prepped with Powell racing parts, same guy(s) who did the cobalt time attack and a few Koni/conti cup ss's. The cars chassis and drive train is the best fwd in the U.S. For track. The fit and finish is lacking the creature comforts are lacking. But as a drivers car, you cannot beat it. Hell the resale is perfect for a buyer. I've had mine since new, only have 35k on a 2009. Never sees snow and barely rain. All I have is a downpipe, intake, and a gm stage 1 tune. I'll be getting the intercooler shorty. Just under 300 to the wheels and it spins all over, no real point going more power with all that torq.

The ms3 was a fantastic rig. I loved being able to haul stuff, but also track it. Stock for stock it was on par with a stage 2 supercharged ir stock turbocharged. Was not as capable on the track but held its own. The creature comforts and fit and finish were top notch. I freaking miss that car. You could raise/lower the hids with a switch. Interior was quality. The sound of the exhaust was beautiful, deep and throaty.  Best part was standard equipment was a LSD, which no other competitor has standard. The SS you have to make sure you got the g85 package.

I have a dd escape 2.0 ecoboost, same engine as the focus st. So I've been modding it and checking the focus forums. The 2.0 had a freaking tiny k03 single scroll turbo and some of the focus owners are a little high on how fast they think it actually is. The 2.0 with a k03 will take off quickly but that turbo is so damn small it looses breath in the top rpms and after 60 ish mph.  The new 2.0 in the 2015 edge and then newer fords I think goes with a twin scroll, but I don't remember. However the 2.3 in the RS will be a twin scroll, hopefully at least a k04 size.

461,Ford,"Oh man I'm straight jelly that you're ordering the RS. That thing should be an absolute beast. For the longest time I ignored the Cobalt SS because I assumed it was one of those cars where they just slapped a performance badge on it to sell more (sorta like MOPAR putting a R/T badge on the Caravan). Then I watched the Regular Car Review on them and was taken back about how good it actually is.

I've driven an ST a couple times and there's no doubt that it's quick and the torque steer is noticeable. I think my favorite thing about the ST however is its gearbox. I think they probably put a single scroll on it because they were planning for the RS all along and needed enough difference between the two to justify it. And hopefully the RS lives up to the hype; but it should with AWD and over 300hp.

What size is your engine?

Have you located the DPFE on your engine yet? If you follow the vacuum lines out of either the EGR valve itself, or the EGR tube, it goes into a little box with 2 vacuum ports. That is your DPFE sensor.

Now that you've located it, is it all plastic, or does it have a metal backing to it? If its metal, it has never been replaced. They are notoriously defective, and have been redesigned. The replacement part has a list price of $111 from Ford.  REPLACE THIS FIRST. This is 99% of the problem for both of the codes listed.

After replacing, clear the codes, do a drive cycle. If the codes stay away, congrats, you are the 99%. If not, fail, you are the 1%. Spray the vacuum lines down with something non corrosive. You will see bubbles. Cut that section out, replace with HEAT TREATED VACUUM LINE. (Important note - each of the 2 rubber lines going into the dpfe have a different inside diameter, they are not both the same).

That will fix ya up.

I mean I didn't even get to enjoy the new car smell because it has been in there for so long.

Unless specifically outlined in some agreement or service contract or your warranty you are not *entitled* to a loaner of any kind, let alone one with matching features. 

That does not mean it isn't good business to do so. As someone who has worked in the service dept too, let me ask that you dont take it out on the advisor. If they could give you what you want, they would. They want to get to work selling too and not running damage control all day. 

I have seen in the past, this was for dodge though, a customer pay the difference on their rental upgrade and then submit the paperwork to Chrysler showing all their charges and ROs confirming it was down in the shop and still be worked on. Chrysler reimbursed them for 80% of the difference and gave them free oil changes good at any dealership for 3 years.

617,Ford,"Absolutely Right! They **should** offer you a loaner but not because you are *entitled* to one but because it is good business and keeping the customer happy is always the right thing to do. **BUT** your question was if you were *entitled* to one and the answer to that question is a resounding no. (Barring something like a service contract or stipulation in your warranty that says otherwise)

As a word from the inside, often the dealership can get some compensation from the factory for covering a loaner too. Often the factory will cover 5 days or so and the dealership may be willing to cover a few days out of their own pocket. But in order for the dealership to cover it they have to submit it as part of a covered warranty repair, basically another add on when they submit for payment on their warranty repairs. No warranty repair submitted, no way to get paid for that loaner. 

So if they aren't able to find anything wrong, they cant submit for reimbursement from Ford. So all the time they are paying their tech to try and figure out whats wrong with you car, including having them drive it around to try and get it to happen, is all money out of their pocket. So they are already out a bunch of money most likely trying to fix your car. And even if they do figure out what is wrong and they do fix it completely. Ford will most likely only pay them the book time to complete the repair and maybe a half hour to an hour diagnostic time for figure it out, even if they had the tech driving your car for 3 days or messing with it trying to figure out what was wrong for hours. Diagnostic time does not get paid as straight time from the factory. 

So keep that in mind, they are spending money on you to try and fix your car. And if they do figure it out and do fix it, then you will most likely be able to submit your rental bills to ford for reimbursement, probably not more than $30 a day (which is the industry standard rental coverage) but they may decide to cover more than that or even all of it. But you honestly will have a chance to get something. 

The dealership however will get an emphatic no to their request for reimbursement for your rental if they cover it.

A lot of it is keeping our suppliers in line with all of our deadlines and requests and basically making sure they're delivering to the best of their abilities. Because we're the customer, I am essentially their boss when it comes to setting schedules and requesting studies and design changes. A lot of the final decisions are made by styling management (designers that draw but don't have a technical background) or purchasing management (basically accountants), but I function as the front line for deciding between designs and solutions. They approve (or decline) my decision, but they only see what I choose as the best proposal. Sometimes its cool because I can make pretty major styling and engineering changes if someone calls out an issue and a major change is the only solution. They're typically too busy to come up with solutions on their own so they have to use my proposals.

The cool thing is that anything I work on I have sole responsibility for once its been handed over by our Japanese or American designers.

But I believed the real reason Ford discontinued the truck was that it was very dated, basically unchanged since 1992. And the federal government's CAFE fuel economy standards put a lot of protections for big trucks and really increased the standards for vehicles with small wheel bases like cars and small trucks. and rather than sell the larger, redesigned international ranger that would have to meet much higher fuel economy standards and risk cannibalizing F-150 sales, Ford decided to cut production.

I've done numerous mods: CAI, Short throw lever, short throw bracket, snorkel delete, HID retrofit headlights, etc. As long as you get the parts from respectable companies (i.e. FSWerks or Steeda) you won't have problems. You can't void your warranty with mods. As u/nikkistl mentioned, if an aftermarket part is proven to cause the problem (like his example of the CAI) then you'll cover that single repair on your own. But if your transmission goes then it'll be covered under warranty. But just so you're aware, experiencing hydrolock is usually seen with a true CAI. A true CAI is one that moves the intake from up in your engine bay down to somewhere where the air is cooler. Usually this means moving the intake down near the front left wheel somewhere in the front fender. This is where hydrolock is most experienced. As far as I know, they don't make true CAIs for our MKIIIs yet. I have one on mine and have driven through very heavy rain and it was fine. 

To sum it up, I wouldn't be worried about any aftermarket parts that are simple bolt-ons: CAI, short throw shifters, sway bars, motor mounts, springs, coilovers, catbacks, etc. Also I would just make sure they are from trusted companies: Steeda, FSWerks, Rebel Devil, The Lighting Firm, etc.

I think you should be ok, as Ford recently extended the warranty on pretty much all of the components of the DCT. I'm guessing you took it in to an independent shop and got a diagnosis. Keep in mind those shops likely have little experience with something like Ford's dual clutch transmissions and may be giving you an incorrect assessment on your car. This transmission has been troublesome enough where pretty much any Ford dealer most likely has at least one mechanic in the bay who is familiar enough with the DCT. My local dealer has one technician solely dedicated to replacing the troublesome components in the Fiesta and Focus. 

My advice would be to drive the car as little as possible since you're nearing the 60,000 mile cut-off. Although I think if you raise enough stink at Ford corporate you should get them to make an exception in your case should the dealer try to charge you any money for whatever repairs you might need. You might also be able to get refunded for however much you spent at the other mechanic for a diagnostic. 

[Here](http://www.focusfanatics.com/forum/mk3-tsb-recall-problems-archive/455833-ford-dual-clutch-warranty-extension-details-new-tsb-clutch-parts.html) is a thread on Focus Fanatics dedicated to the warranty extension you should check out. You might want to also create an account there and establish a relationship with Ford Service on the forum, as they're pretty active on that site and could potentially help you out if you encounter an issue with the dealer. If you truly think the car is unsafe to drive, I would see if you could get a rental car, although I'm not sure how your local dealer handles something like that, or if you're entitled to one under the warranty. If your car is drivable then it is likely that its some components of the transmission itself and not the whole assembly itself. Finally, if you feel like the dealer is not being helpful, you might want to consider going to another Ford dealer to get the work done. 

Hope this helps.

1051,Ford,"haha, someone finally caught me!  Nice.",1.0
1052,Ford,"Pay attention!!!!!

Okay. So here's the deal. I'll tell you what the technician at the Ford dealership will do. I can tell you this because I'm one of the guys that he will call when he can't figure it out. Since it neutrals, stumbles, and grinds, they'll perform what's called an Adaptive Relearn. This will give the TCM a chance to relearn all of the operating parameters that it uses to make this unique piece of magic to work. This process clears all of the learned KAM from the module and is essentially a reset for the TCM. If that doesn't help, they'll take a fluid sample based on the grinding noises (if it is indeed coming from the transmission) to inspect it for debris. If debris is present, removal and disassembly will be required. 

If the issue is with the clutch or clutch system, and no debris was present, there will be a warranty extension available as an FSA. The grinding noise present can be a result of a fault with the clutch. If the clutch isn't/doesn't/can't fully disengage, then the input shaft will obviously be spinning and can make the next gear engagement have an issue. The next concern comes if they decide they have to replace the clutch. Immediately let them know you'll need assistance with the rental vehicle you'll have to get. The clutches are on backorder for eight to twelve weeks. That's not Ford's fault btw, the supplier can't supply for the demand. 

The large amount of clutch replacements isn't necessarily always due to a clutch fault. If the rear main leaks and the engine oil gets on the clutch, boom! Replacement required. If release bearing grease gets on it? Pow! Replacement required. 

This transmission (called a DPS6, DPS, or PS195) is extremely unique and is quite honestly some awesome technology. People bad mouth it for all the problems it seems to run into but there is almost no other transmission out there that is like it. Very few. Even with as much diagnosis as I provide these transmissions, I love them for their innovation and sheer technical awesomeness. 

Please take note, I am not acting in this comment on behalf of Ford Motor, Co. Merely providing some information to some inquiring minds :).

The lady driving it had no idea that it had been added in because she had bought the car used it it was already there. The same might be the case with this car, if it was purchased this way. 

While it looks cool, I wonder what it did for the structural integrity of the car. The roof does a lot to help keep cars from flexing, particularly in corners. If additional bracing wasn't added, now that I think about it, it might be more terrifying than fun to drive.

•	Transmission cooler leak

•	Transmission shaft leak (mostly left side half shaft)

•	Rear window water leak

Check these parts are in good working order and seal up the rear window and you have eliminated 80-90% of any potential future problems.

The new engines in the 09-12 have a bit more HP and MPG the other duratecs AND the newer 6 speed 6F35 is (reportedly) much improved over the CD4E 4 speed trans.

I'm a Service Engineer with the Ford Technical Assistance Center (fancy name for I work on the Ford Hotline, shutup and let me have my moment). As such, I gotta say that I'm commenting on my own behalf and none of what I'm about to say comes from Ford or represents Ford's opinions, they're all my own. Also, you're doubly in luck b/c my focus is Transmissions and Drivelines. 

Now on to the meat and potatoes. The half-shaft leak that you've probably heard of is only a small issue with the AWD models, not so much with the FWD. And there aren't any recurring issues with the cooler leaking. Unfortunately I can't speak for the window sealing concern as I'm not in the Body/Chassis group so whatever you've heard is probably a better guess than I could give. 

The 6F series of transmissions is rather good and a lot better than the old CD's. They're in pretty much everything that isn't a truck or transit. There's the 6F mid-range that's in the smaller vehicles and then there's the bigger, beefier cousin 6F50/55 that comes in models with a little more get up and go. 

There has been an issue with the torque converter clutch not being engaged/disengaged properly but it's only a recurring thing that we SE's notice. The other engineering branches haven't been concerned with it and there is no recalls/TSBs/SSMs or internal messages about them. 

All in all, the Escapes are wonderful. If it were me, I'd try to go with a `10 or `11 but that's my personal preference and you don't have to listen. I don't feel like I provided that much information but I hope it was helpful somehow lol.",3.0

1301,Ford,"Had a ~600whp 2007 GT500 for a year (did the mods myself) - did the 2013 TVS + CAI + Tune, bumped the stock HP about 125hp.

A few thoughts after driving it around for a year like that:

* 1. This was a wonderful mod, really woke the car up.
* 2. I should have done the cooling system as well because in the summer the difference between 110 degree afternoon drive in traffic (Arizona) and 70 degree morning fresh start _felt_ like 150 HP difference... I have no idea what it really was, but it was DRASTIC.
* 3. Getting to 650HP is pretty easy and gives you enough power you are going to smoke the tires in 1st and 2nd. Getting &gt; 650hp starts getting expensive exponentially... to wacky's point -- sure, you can do 800, but now you are dropping some SERIOUS money to get there.

Twin-turbo is cool, if you can stick with quick-spooling turbos to get your boost online early (2k or lower) go for it. If you can't get them to spool until like 3500, then I think you miss out a bit on a fun RPM range.

If you can get into an already boosted one, liek the GT500 so you can just ""go bigger"" that's an easy way to start VS starting with naturally aspirated and then needing to change out everything under the hood -- but PLENTY of people do it, so maybe a non-issue... I just found my mods trivial to do because 'everything was already sitting there'.

That said... 

If you can't afford $35 for a shop manual, the car is probably not roadworthy, and shouldn't be driven until you get a job and can service it properly. Ride a bike until the car is safe to use around other motorists. 

Getting it ""running"" is not your only priority. Getting it SAFE to drive is most important.

1316,Ford,Can recognise that airbox anywhere! ,2.0
1317,Ford,"I just got my Car back from the dealership in Yellowknife NT for the same issue. They replaced and reprogrammed the clutch and the situation improved a fair bit but the jerkiness at low rpm  is annoying as fuck and as a first time car owner is fuckin bs. Apparently a vast majority of focuses  and Fiestas  have Transmissions that shit the bed very early in their life span. It's enough to have caused class action lawsuits in the US apparently. Further,I guess people don't know what they're getting when buying  a DCT transmission which I guess is an automatic/manual hybrid. Ford knows all about the issue and has extended warranties and done full replacements but they also tend to blame the driver which is really unfair. Needless to say I'll be trading mine in at the end of its 5 years for a vehicle with a traditional automatic.",1.0

1319,Ford,Ford did replace my Trans and the car still sucks in low gear. It's a huge issue apparently. How does the lemon law work? Do you get out of your contract?,1.0

1323,Ford,"Take a look at a XR6T, you can work them alot easier, cheaper rego etc.  I'd say take a look at a used FG XR6T, they go quite a bit harder than the BF, BA models. Great bang for buck if you have the cash.",2.0
1324,Ford,"Looking for a ford my self, found this, http://www.themotorreport.com.au/3729/2008-fg-falcon-revealed

Seems to be more minor adjustments and improvements than anything else",2.0
1325,Ford,"Thanks for that. I have done some research this avo too. A huge step in 2011 was the introduction of the EcoLpi, which has more power than the ULP version and is faster.

The upgraded FG looks a lot nicer too. Only a few extra thousand can get you to jump from a 2007 to a 2011 model, which seems worth it really. To think how much they cost new, they really are a steal after a few years.

Good luck with your next purchase.",1.0
1326,Ford,"only got 12k, I do like the xr6t but I think I'd like a v8 as they are slowly fading away. 
Like I'd like to own one, but I'm honestly not too fussed, I just need a daily and some XR8 fall into the price bracket.
Which XR6T BA mk2? I know the later model has the better gearbox/transmission but I plan on keeping it stock",1.0
1327,Ford,"Just remember, it's a car. The value will always be going down no matter what it is. The Barra engine is a proven reliable model if the maintenance is kept up with. 

You might even snag a BF with a ZF 6 Speed if you look carefully. But I haven't checked prices in a long time. 

With all that being said, keep in mind this is my opinion and an opinion only. Do your research and ask around over at the Aussie Ford Forums. They'll be happy to help.",1.0

1330,Ford,"Not sure where this picture was taken, but when you have a DRW truck in bad weather, making it SRW can help with ice/snow and even rain traction. Instead of floating on top from all the contact of the tires, you sink in a little more ""pizza cutter effect"" and can get your tires to touch the pavement. I'm not sure if this is the case here, but just my two cents. ",1.0
1331,Ford,Random question. Are you able to actually drive your car onto those ramps? Or do you have to jack the car up and slide them under the tires? I had a pair at my parents house but they would always slide when I tried to drive up them.,1.0
1332,Ford,"Go a BF rather than a BA. BAs have a shitty 4 speed box thats prone to a quick death under stress.

I have an Xr6T but I think in hindsight i should have gone an 8 since im not chasing power on a budget and I prefer the V8 sound..",1.0
1333,Ford,So i got my free transmission and clutch but the gears still slip in the lower gears the jutting and dragging is quite obvious. It's okay once it gets past 50Km/hr but slow driving is a joke. I've read that the clutch issue is massive and Ford rarely tunes the transmissions to 100%. What should I do? I can take it back to ford over and over but i'd rather not do that. ,1.0
1334,Ford,"Got a 2 year lease on a 2015 edge sport, car is pretty much fully loaded but it doesn't have the front camera self parking package, which I really didn't care for.

The Vista roof is probably my favorite feature.",6.0
1335,Ford,I'm a lube tech at a Ford dealer and a half shaf leak is almost a given on 90% of the escapes I see. They tend not to leak after being fixed the first time. Also the 3.0 leaks from the front cover a lot and it's a very expensive fix. Only other common problem I see is sway bar links going bad quickly,2.0
1336,Ford,Looks awesome! Enjoy,2.0
1337,Ford,"My dad had a MkII XR8, was a great car, really nice sound and everything. Never got to drive it unfortunately, as I was too young.

That said, if you can, get a BF. They're better equipped, and have slightly better power and economy. If you're not fussed about having a V8, get a 6 Turbo, they're arguably better in almost every aspect.",1.0
1338,Ford,"Oh man I've had two 2005's. Both ate end links.

The v6 had seeping on the lower engine. And only the v6 had a bad axle on the front passenger side. Otherwise my 2.3 awd went to 156k miles and was totaled and the 3.0 I traded in at 130k. Only other issue was alternators on both went about 120k

",7.0
1364,Ford,There is a little in line tester tool that has a light in it that flashes with each spark.  That will test the coil and wires.  Or you can simply pull out all of them and then plug the wires back onto them and carefully lay them open resting somewhere on the head away from all other things/wires/moving parts.  Then have somebody eyeball them as you turn the car over.  They have to be touching the head to make the circuit work.  A lot of air and gas vapor will be blowing up through the open spark plug holes FYI.  That will also let you smell the gas.,1.0
1365,Ford,Well first i would crank it for a long time.  Get a battery charger.,1.0

I can check my gf's 2012 fusion to see if that is similar, but that won't be until Sunday. I'll check my escape but not sure how close those are.

If you can swing by an auto parts store they may be of assistance. And they are open later.",2.0
1368,Ford,Looks fucking awesome!,2.0
1369,Ford,The hose runs up and to a T which is like a round piece that connects to the nozzle for the passenger side and the drivers side just is a round part only.  Kind of hard to explain ha.  If you find out let me know.  I'm going. To autozone tomorrow afternoon after work. ,1.0

1390,Ford,Get ready to fill up often. ,1.0
1391,Ford,"I prefer the new over the old, maybe the blacked out grill is selling me?

The new LEDs look awesome, especially since they run 24/7 with the headlights so it always has that look.

The rear is kinda tricky. When I saw pictures of it, I hated it, but in person it truly did grown on me. It's not the most unique taillight but it's awesome at night. Being the sport, the whole light bar lights up when I break, and it uses LEDs so it's bright and clean.

The side has the sport trim going around so it does give a sportier look.

Interior is much better. I can't emphasize on how much more roomier it is, the technology is better than the previous model (al thought I'm still stuck with myfordtouch). Lots of new features.
They finally got rid of the annoying touch sensors for radio and temperature with let me tell you is the best thing. 
The panel is so clean and easy to use. 

Steering wheel is a tad bit smaller, they changed the light and window wiper sticks to a new design, still has the dial on the left for outside lights.
Back seats recline and holy crap they made the trunk huge compared to last model.

Beautiful car, only thing I really dislike is in the old model, you used to be able to spin the dial all the way to the left and the car would essentially black out. No light emitted at all besides the interior touch screen. In this model when you spin the dial the LEDs stay illuminated and they can be seen from far, so no more sneaking around haha.

Besides that I love it. Twin turbo is fun to drive around with, AWD so I'm set for the next michigan winter.

I would recommend you go to Tractor Supply and get a low profile in-bed tool box. I used to store my crap in the back seat area and those popout windows are expensive to replace (at least $350, usually more). Get a toolbox and keep your valuables, any backpacks, some basic tools and emergency supplies back there at all times.

This along with headers, actual dual exhaust with an H or X pipe and 2.5"" pipes and you will make some decent power even with the stock truck intake etc...

It would also stay in 2nd or 3rd gear going down a hill when it should've definitely been in 3rd or 4th respectively, it always felt like it was loading up.

It felt alien. So Toyota incorporated simulated shift points- the transmission doesn't stay in its optimum gear range 100% of the time- it lets the speed build up and then jumps forward a bit to get into the most efficient range. After incorporating this, the focus group testing went through the roof positive. So, to make people happy with this new technology, they had to sacrifice a little bit of efficiency.

This may be an economy car, but it is a $19000 economy car, and I expect more. Getting oil changed now and they'll take it for a drive.  The rep told me just now that it is noisier than the 2003 because they use lighter material, plastics, etc. Earlier at home I revved the engine in park, and it was pretty quiet, even up to almost redline. The excess noise is happening when it is being driven, so if nothing is wrong with it according to Toyota, I'm guessing the noise is coming from the CVT itself or maybe a sound booster of some sort. Maybe I should just go the other way and do something to the exhaust to make this car ridiculously loud. At least then it wouldn't sound like a weedeater. ",1.0
53,Toyota,"I'm fairly certain there is no artificial noise on a corolla, those are mostly for cars that used to have a signature sound or a lot of power and loud sounds. When a person buys a corolla they know they're getting a rather weak engine with great mileage. If you keep your foot pressed down, it will stay in high rpms until you get to your desired speed, thus producing a LOT of unnecessary noise. In my experience it will only have artificial shift points when it is almost all the way to the floor when it's near redline. However my normal driving habits I prefer to keep my rpms under 2000 while accelerating and it's a very quiet car. (2014 Corolla S+).

On the highway, it is illegal in Texas to drive under the speed limit in the passing lane, but that doesn't stop Barney Fife from waiting behind a tree to write you up so the locals in his area don't have to pay property tax.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIswrodoM8

When you look at the head unit, it is a little different than this guys stereo but it helps you to understand how to do it to your own car. 
It's a little risky as if you are not decent at soldering or understanding some basic electronics, then you could mess up the head unit.
You just have to take the head unit out and then remove the back and top of the unit, once you open it up there is a spot on the board where the cassette tape player is connected to the main board.  and then find the spot near it that looks like the one the guy in the video uses(if i remember right there are two spots like this in the area)  but the one i used was toward the front of unit and close to the volume/power button side.  Take the aux cable that you want to use and cut off one end and strip and separate the 3 internal wires. connect the ground wire (normally the winding) to one of the screws holding the board on (there is one about an inch away from the connection point) then solder the positive wire (normally red) of the aux cable to the spot on the board marked with a ""+"" and the negative(white normally) to the ""-"" spot.  then you just have to run the cable to where ever you want your connection point.

It's definitely worth it because that is a very good, powerful, and reliable head unit.  You will get perfect quality music playing as long as you give it good music to begin with.

As a side note to this, EPA estimates really are very liberal these days it seems like.  I will say I've been able to best my EPA estimates on my 2011 Honda Insight, but it's really really tough and requires excessive 'hypermiling' to do.

I employ hypermilling to an extent, as the cruise control isn't worth anything above ~45 MPH. Low speed with no stopping, it's great, but on the highway, it's worthless. My tachometer flies sky-high, my fuel economy displayed will drop to 20-25 MPG, and it's mildly infuriating how inefficient it is.

Due to that, I try to keep a constant eye on my MPG and make minor adjustments accordingly to keep it as high as I can.

My last vehicle was the first vehicle I kept detailed statistics about, and, while it wasn't the greatest, at least my overall MPG was above the in-city estimates.

294,Toyota,Balancing the tires will not fix loose steering - you need to have the steering rack inspected.,2.0
295,Toyota,"Which tires are on it?
What pressure do you set them at?
How many miles on your truck?
I've got a 2014, the factory tires are total crap, the sidewalls are the strength of donuts.  I've been through several trucks in the past. Passenger car tires (See that P on your sidewall) aren't good for steering on trucks with large high profile tires.  Mine also have a slight out-of-balance shimmy feel to them at specific highway speeds.

First step: Make sure your tire pressure is good. The door sills say 32psi front/rear, but I found running mine at 35 front/rear firms up the ride just enough to get rid of quite a bit of the steering vagueness from those crappy tires.
Also depending on your mileage, there's a couple other guesses I'd have;
Stock shocks are toast, buy quality replacement shocks
Steering stabilizer might be toast, but I'd be looking at shocks first anyway.
Replace the tires with quality LT (light truck) rated tires, and I bet you the steering will firm right up.
Swaybar issues shouldn't be happening on a vehicle this new, so I'd doubt that is it.

Also, used certified doesn't really mean anything other than they ran through a standard set of checks. Look at all the exceptions on the paperwork, you'll be shocked. (Mine is CPO also)  And on top of course, they really have no interest in fixing anything minor.  Standard wear and tear usually won't be considered.",1.0

Most shops just replace the entire steering rack, at the cost of about a $1,000. It's usually just a bushing though. 

I'd say get a second opinion by taking to a place like a good tire shop, and ask them to either give it an alignment, or have them check the alignment. When it's on the rack, they'll be able to note any slop in the steering as they're trying to align the front end. 

If you want to try and check it yourself, you can try putting a camera under your truck and aim it towards the bushing on the steering rack. You can then play the video back and see if there is any slop in it. Having another person watch the bushing for a safe distance works too. Please use caution when doing any of this. ",1.0

Let me get some perspective on the cost issue. Are you looking for something that is daily driver worthy that you can also tinker with, or are you looking for a rally project that you're going to gut and probably wind up destroying in the woods somewhere. Because if it's the former a $1300 Corolla might not be bad (assuming the vehicle is in good enough shape to justify the cost) but if you're looking for a project car you can do a lot better.

Also as another member said have you changed your water pump?

My thinking is your IC is dumping a lot of heat  to the ambient air and your cooling system isn't capable of handling the decrease in efficiency from 40+degree C air. 

Some countermeasures could include a remote oil cooler mounted in front of the driver side wheel well, an electric booster water pump, or an improved radiator.

First confirm you cooling system does not have any issues. Check the water temp sensor by running 12V through the circuit and putting it in 0Degree C water and read the resistance from an Ohm meter. 

Also are there any other issues? Power loss? If so you could check the engine compression. Change the oil and check if it's milky.",1.0

Front differential howl. I'm unsure of the long-term effects of letting this problem go, but I can't imagine that a differential that isn't clearanced properly is good for anything. You might want to double-check this on some of the Tundra forums, but I believe the check for this was to drive about 50 km/h on a straight, flat road, and let your foot off the gas pedal. Listen closely for a noise that could be a low hum or a noticeable howl. Put the truck in 4WD mode, and if the noise goes away, you've got diff howl.

At first it was alarming too, but I got in touch with a couple of SUV mechanics (some Toyota, some independent) and was assured that it is normal. Here's why: At the 110kph mark, the full time 4WD of this vehicle disengages / re-engages. This happens automatically, with no intervention from the driver apart from driving at that particular speed. The reasoning behind this being 4WD is usually not called for in speeds of excess of 110kph, and is usually used in driving situations involving speeds below 110kph. The sound you hear should be accompanied with a light vibration through the steering wheel. 

The solution is to not stay at that transitionary speed but rather 6-10kph above it or below it. (Since the reason for the vibration/sound is the constant disengagement and engagement of the 4WD at that speed.) Unfortunately this is the only solution that gave me a concrete result of the elimination of the sound and vibration. ",1.0

1012,Toyota,"Yes, it's an interference design. 

Unless you're very comfortable with a timing belt replacement, don't do it yourself. Also, I would assume that doing this work on a van would be even more difficult than any other body style. 

Also, replace the water pump with this timing belt. It's not that much more labor, and the pump isn't that expensive. But the labor to replace it on it's own, is huge. 


Edit:
Also, be prepared for replacing things like the tensioner or a pulley. At 177k, they might be near the end of their life cycle. This isn't the time to scrimp on a repair bill. 

When I owned a 4Runner, I would tell my mechanic to replace anything to do with the timing belt, or cooling system, if it looked bad. I sold that truck with over 250k miles (km equivalent), and never had a problem with it. ",1.0

1018,Toyota,"OK, I do these t belts multiple times a week so let me give you the skinny. If you MUST do it yourself ( which I don't really recommend unless you're familiar with it) be sure to purchase a Toyota brand factory replacement belt. They have marks on them indicating their correct position on the crankshaft and camshafts which are important since getting a good look at the timing marks on the rear bank is quite difficult.
Ideally you would replace the cam and crank oil seals when you do the belt. If they are original, they will be very hard by this point and are getting more and more likely to leak. Plus, you'll remove the shield behind the gears to replace them, which you need to do anyway for my last point.
 Water pump, replace it. No excuse not to. These things leak, the bearings go bad, etc. This is just as likely to fail as the belt and all of the labor would be wasted if you have to go right back in there when it fails.
A lot of people replace the tensioner and it's pulley as well as the idler puller. I personally don't believe in replacing them unless the tensioner has become weak or the bearing in one of the pulleys is loose or noisy. Honestly, this is extremely rare.
Be prepared. Although professionals can do this job in 2-3 hours (we Toyota techs range from 45 minutes to 1.5 hrs) you will likely take most of a day.

Sure, the F-series cars are much faster due to super-fast transmissions and turbocharging, but you can certainly do this with any older BMW.  

I've considered looking at Porsche's, but they aren't really in the same class of car.  Neither is a Corvette, Mustang or Camaro.  You can't dial-in to one aspect of a car and say ""well, this is better than BMW"" and call it a day.  This debate has been going on for ages.  BMW has always been about well-roundedness blended in to a package that can be driven daily; something far more exciting than a Camry, but perhaps not quite as reliable as one.  Unfortunately, it's turned in a ""me-too"" brand like an iPhone and this has inevitably diluted things.

I think BMW is kind of listening to the enthusiasts (next-gen 5-series is going on a much-needed diet) because they are the hardcore fans of the brand, and some fresh blood (those who are new to BMW) is always in good supply, which helps tremendously with avoiding a Cadillac-like purgatory.  Every car brand is going to have it's kids whose parents buy them a car and they have no flippin' clue what a car is other than it needs gas and you put the gear selector in D to go.  But you don't blame the kids for that, they don't know any better because their parents never paid attention.  The point being in that BMW is torn - trying to hang-on to it's classic traits, while trying to keep selling cars and increasing sales to satisfy the masses.  They'll get the formula right again, eventually.  ",3.0

Also, that spoiler seems pretty small and tasteful compared to some of the wings people put on their cars. I just don't know if it really adds to the look that much, as the trunk already has a bit of a lip to it. It's your call, but I wouldn't see a 640 that looks like that and think what a silly wannabe the same way I do when I look at that 428.

However, your whole ride has a pretty obvious black on white theme going so really it would just balance that out from back to front. For example, in the front you've got black kidneys and black reflectors, in the middle you've got black wheels and the shadowline trim, and then the spoiler/exhaust in black would finish off the back end with some consistency. All in all I like it. Personally I would urge you to resist any urges to get a lip spoiler or black out the mirrors though.

I mean, it's not like the opinions of others really matter, it's your ride and if it makes you smile when you see it then money well spent. And hey maybe a tune and debadge could follow that up ;)

I've seen some 640s that go with things like the lip spoiler, black mirrors, black vinyl on the roof, and anything else to try to make it look like an M6. That's really what I want to avoid. I have wet dreams about the M6 GC, but I'm not about to try to make mine look like one. But, I do like the look of the CF spoiler, and I'm glad to hear it won't push me into wannabe territory. I might go to the dealer tomorrow to see if they have one in stock.

Funny you mention the tune, since I put a JB4 and intake on after about 1,000 miles. Love 'em. I might debadge, but I went with the glossy black numbers for now. I also thought about laying some glossy vinyl over the door handle inserts and other side markers. That would be easy to remove if I didn't like it.

Lastly, you'd have to pry the 435 out of my wife's hands, unfortunately!! Funny thing is that she got me into BMWs. I've always had trucks, and she talked me into getting her a brand new 328xi Coupe back in 2008. That was a fun starter BMW that got us both hooked. Next, she got an X3 and I got a 528xi a couple years ago, but we didn't care for the N20 engine, so we both traded up to cars with the N55, which we both love. She rarely lets me drive her car, and I'm married to her. Although, that could be due to my hitting a deer with her 328xi when she was out of town!

I take it you need money to satisfy your BMW craving, yes? If so, I completely understand. Granted, we are spoiled to have our current cars, but when it comes to BMW, there's always something else to lust after. Hers is an X6 and mine is the M6 GC. Definitely not happening anytime soon!",1.0

The smoking issue is probably caused by the infamous stem seal leak. Which is going to cost thousands to repair. The symptoms match it.

From a dead stop it always felt like the motor skipped a beat before accelerating when pulling out.

Seat ripped in 2 weeks, took a lot of fighting to get audi to cover the repair.

Rotors warped inside of 10k miles.

Something still wrong with the front left CV joint, never pinpointed never fixed.

Minor annoyance, had my service done by an independent shop and audi refused to sell the codes to turn off the service due light, and wouldn't do it themselves when in for recall or warranty work unless I paid 50 bucks for it.

And it had a little problem of burning oil.  Audi settled a class action lawsuit over this issue but every few thousand miles I needed a quart of oil no matter how many times they tried to fix it.  Then again, it was a materials defect in the cylinders and outside of changing the motor the fix wasn't effective.  Not to mention, the service department always were a major pain in the ass about it.

Yeah, you can run 100 octane gas or E85 mix or etc in the N20 if you want with a tune, But you're also going to have to go out of the way to get the said fuels.

And also, a 428i with a jb4 and no bolt ons on 93 octane fuel, is slower than a stock 435i.

And the entire point of a having a larger engine is that it performs better stock, sounds better, and has higher ouput potential.

Sure, if you want to do it as cheap, you can get the performance of a 435i for cheaper than the 435i, but if you want more, you're pretty much better off getting a 435i since it'll be cheaper once you get to a little past the stock 435i power.",1.0

676,BMW,My First Girlfriend! http://i.imgur.com/bNHTl2j.jpg ,14.0
677,BMW,"I bought a CPO 2014 428xi about 3 months ago.  It's the first BMW I've owned so I did my due diligence before purchasing.  I'll pass along the research I did and my impressions of the first few months of ownership.    

The 428 is equipped with the N20B20 engine.  This engine has been around since 2011 and was first utilized on the new F30 3-series.  It was named one of Wards 10Best Engines in 2012.  It is rated at 242hp/255ft-lb; however BMW's turbo engines are known for being slightly underrated.  My 428 dynoed at 232hp to the wheels, which means it makes closer to 265-270 hp at the crank.  The engine is plenty powerful enough for the car.  As an aside, a 428i coupe weighs around 3500lb, with the xDrive weighing closer to 3750.  If you are worried about issues with BMW's turbo engines (like the POS N54 in the E90 335), you'll be happy to know that it seems that BMW finally figured out how to turbo an engine without grenading the high-pressure fuel pump.  I had concerns about buying a turbo BMW after watching my friend's 335 spend half its life in the shop, but the N20B20 has been around for 3 years and seems to be very reliable.

The car gets great gas mileage (I see about 23 city and 31 highway, and the non-xDrive model should get slightly better than that).  

Not sure what year your Audi is but I've driven a 2012 A5 2.0T coupe; the 428i is noticeably quicker but doesn't feel as light on its feet as the A5.  If your A5 has hydraulic steering (pre-2013 MY), the 428 is NOT going to feel as responsive to drive.  All 4-series models have electric steering, and while it saves weight it just doesn't feel as responsive as a hydraulic setup.  

Mine has the automatic transmission (ZF 8-speed) and it is fantastic, especially in sport/sport+ mode.  Haven't driven a manual 4-series so I couldn't tell you much about that.   
 
I have had no issues with my car at all in the first 3 months of ownership.  I did up the warranty to 6yr/70k miles because I live in Iowa and you have to drive 5 hours to get to any major city, so I will be putting a lot of miles on the car.  If you do decide to get an extended warranty, do it when you buy the car because the cost will go up as you put on more miles.  Also the warranty covers all scheduled maintenance for the remainder of 4yrs/50k miles, which was a huge factor for me when purchasing.

In regards to my personal ownership experience, I have been nothing short of impressed with this car.  It seems extremely well constructed (and this is coming from someone that used to work at a Mercedes-Benz factory).  It's quick, powerful, has a great transmission and is immensely fun to drive.  The 428 has near-exact 50/50 weight distribution, and in my experience handles better than a 435 in the corners (distribution on the 435 is 52/48 front/rear).  I have had no mechanical/electrical issues with the car at all.

748,BMW,"Chumpskibot actually incorrectly pointed out that this exhaust would *increase* back pressure.  I, like you, definitely don't agree that the Corsa system is engineered in such a way.  However, I believe that loss of back pressure on a turbo car downstream is good for power.  Per a Garret engineer: 

&gt;Downstream of the turbine (aka the turboback exhaust), you want the least backpressure possible. No ifs, ands, or buts. Stick a Hoover on the tailpipe if you can. The general rule of ""larger is better"" (to the point of diminishing returns) of turboback exhausts is valid. Here, the idea is to minimize the pressure downstream of the turbine in order to make the most effective use of the pressure that is being generated upstream of the turbine. Remember, a turbine operates via a pressure ratio. For a given turbine inlet pressure, you will get the highest pressure ratio across the turbine when you have the lowest possible discharge pressure. This means the turbine is able to do the most amount of work possible (i.e. drive the compressor and make boost) with the available inlet pressure.

Multiple Z8's, including the Alpina variant.  Someone has a Z1 concept, which was very surprising.  One other guy brings his 1M usually, although sometimes there are a couple. Both of the M tuned Zs (carbio and coupés). Then of course you have a plethora of all the different M3s, M5s, M6s, and now M4s from over the years, including special editions and such. Also a bunch of different models of 2002s. And of course this gentleman brings his baby, which is quite the attraction.  The turnout is really great, and the people are super nice, you just get the chance to talk about BMWs and cars in general for a few hours.

864,BMW,"Not including sale of the automatic you're taking out, you'd be looking at roughly $600ish for a decent trans, $450 for a flywheel (new/OE), $200 for a clutch (new/OE M5), $100-200 for the driveshaft, and maybe $200-400 in other misc parts. You can go fancier and do a UUC SSK with DSSR and nice knob like I did but that drives the price up.

It's very hard to ballpark because your cost on the big parts as well as the smaller ones (you can buy used on a lot of things like the slave cylinder, pedal cluster, hard lines, etc but some things should be new such as the moving clutch parts not included with a clutch kit, etc). I would say you should budget at  least $2000-2500 not including labor or sale of the old transmission coming out.

The xDrive system is really for maintaining traction when the car slips and not a performance option, so a lot of people (this is opinion, mind you) believe that not taking a car the way it was designed will interfere with the real driving experience.  Two examples: until very recently, BMW did not differentiate the sport from normal suspensions on the xi/xDrive cars (at least I'm sure on the e90 generations which I had an e90 335xi, the X6s have a more performance oriented AWD system), and all of the M cars (not SUVs) are RWD.

Auto mode (D) is great for granny driving around town but Sport mode (DS) is too clunky for me, especially in traffic.  

I find that D mode will shift early into higher gears and be reluctant to downshift immediately.  The first time it unexpectedly downshifts from 3rd to 2nd under load at low speed, your passengers are probably going to complain. 

An example would be coming out of a turn at low speed in 3rd gear, and you lean on the throttle.  Your revs are too low to build boost quickly in third and you want to go now, so you feed in some more throttle and the tranny downshifts to 2nd (while the turbos are spooling).  The next thing you know, the arguably too-short 2nd gear has you rocketing off into space and your passengers are bitching and moaning about your driving style.

Most of the time, I just find myself putting it in Manual (M) mode and shifting myself.  Starting in 2nd gear from a stop provides the smoothest driving experience.

1115,BMW,"I'm not sure what a valve block is. But I'm guessing they mean the mechatronic. The mechatronics were known to crap out around 70k miles on E60, E63, and E65 models, although any BMW equipped with the ZF 6-speed automatic transmission can be affected. The mechatronics, also known as a valve body, is the transmission control unit that controls shifting time and smoothness. If the transmission fluid/filter wasn't replaced at all before, it's most likely the case. 

A few other things to note is that the transmission filter pan gasket normally starts to leak around 50k-60k miles. Aside from the dirty transmission fluid, the fluid might be low. There are two seals inside the mechatronic that can cause shifting problems if they begin to leak. One is the mechatronic sleeve adapter and the other is the mechantronic bridge adapter. Both are about $30 each and should be replaced if the mechatronic is being serviced/replaced. 

The mechatronics is also pretty expensive. If that price includes a new mechatronic, transmission fluid, filter, and labor, then yes that is a good price. 

To answer your question. If it is the mechatronics, it will continue to get worse. In most cases, the transmission itself will be fine if the fluid hasn't dropped below a certain point. If you trust your mechanic and they have the proper BMW diagnostic software, there really isn't a reason to take it to BMW. 

I have an 06 E60 550i and started developing shifting problems around 72k miles. A transmission fluid and filter replacement and changing out the mechatronic adapters along with an adaptation reset resolved most of the shifting problems. I also had the EGS/DME updated which also improved shifting quality. I still have some minor shifting annoyances, but the car is still drivable for the most part.

1122,BMW,"AWD is an advantage only when your power is too much for your tires' available traction to handle. This applies to most cars on snow and ice, and to insanely powered cars like the Veyron almost any time. Otherwise it is a disadvantage. You have added weight, complexity, cost, parasitic drag, and you're adding more burden to the front wheels which ideally should only have to handle braking and cornering. When you add accelerating back into the mix you're shifting the balance of the car further towards understeer. Understeer is safe and boring.

For day-to-day driving in snowy and icy conditions AWD *is* an advantage for those that don't want to have to switch to dedicated snow tires, or at least to not have to do it as early. If you never see snow or ice, AWD is a cost and complexity liability. If you want maximum performance on a dry track when racing or a road for enthusiastic driving, AWD is a weight and front wheel cornering traction liability.

And as far as winter driving is concerned, AWD is definitely nice (I bought my wife a c300 4matic). But most RWD guys will tell you it's not necessary, and that winter tires will get pretty close to the feel of AWD with summer tires. I just prefer the white knuckle approach, and fishtailing. ",2.0

BUT, if you just wanna show up you can buy as many tickets as you want. You don't even really need to buy em if you don't want to. You could easily stroll right in and pretend you are a neighbor (but it would be better if you paid). It's a town park that used to be a guy's house in the early 20th century. He was very wealthy and was friends with Isabella Stewart Gardner [same as the museum], and she persuaded him to leave his house and land to the town of Brookline when he died, which led to it becoming an awesome park (the Gardner Museum has the letter she sent him in a case on display to the public I believe; all the aristocratic Bostonians used to summer in Brookline, and the park is just down the street from Frederick Law Olmstead's house, which is also a National Historic Society site you could visit while you're here). Larz Anderson was an auto enthusiast, and left his vehicles and a trust to be used to turn his house into a museum, just like her! Her museum is way more famous, obviously, and houses an insane collection of art that you should absolutely check out if you are in Boston. 

BUT ENOUGH WITH HISTORY!!!!!!!

If you want to register you can do so beforehand or they also offer you the ability to do so at the gate. So you needn't commit to anything you don't want to do. 

The judges will walk around and inspect the cars that have the ticket indicating they have entered the contest and just before the end they announce the winners over the loudspeaker. There are 25 categories to be judged on. 

Also, at night, although the town doesn't allow you to be in a park after dusk, it offers a phenomenal view of the city skyline.  The police will roll through occasionally, so if you wanna reduce your chances of getting bothered, park with your engine facing the city. They will assume you are a couple having sex and not some teenagers smoking weed, and most likely not bother you. 

To explicitly answer your question, you don't need to commit to anything, and everything can be done at the event. Including entrance into the contests. 

I got totally off track there. But I hope I answered your question, and if you come, I hope you enjoy Boston!",1.0

In terms of repairs, they quoted me around 500. I looked online and it is doable if you want to do it yourself. You might need a garage, and taking apart the oil filter and gasket, you will spill oil most likely so you will have to clean it up, clean the area where the gasket sits. Lots of manual labour.

The gaskets have nothing to do with the water pump. The water pump on the N54 is a common failure point, and can fail at any time, and will likely fail sometime before 50k-70k miles.

The most important point that everybody is missing is that the g30 will be the second to use the next-gen CLAR platform (after the g11 7-series) which will reduce est. 80kg from model weight.  VIA BMWBLOG  (http://www.bmwblog.com/2015/04/02/2016-holds-the-future-for-bmw/)

""The current F10 5 Series is getting a bit long in the tooth and starting to look dull in comparison to the newer entries in the segment. However, the next-gen G30 5 Series will be a massive leap forward. The G30 will sit upon the CLAR platform, which is the beginning of the future platform sharing, and will be able to share different front axles with different cars, depending on engines. For example, while using four-cylinder engines, the G30 5er will use the front axle from the next-gen 3 Series, which will give it a sportier, more nimble front-end. If it’s equipped with a six or eight-cylinder engine, the 5 Series will use the 7 Series’ front axle, give it a more luxurious feel. Combine all of that innovation with the fact that the G30 will feature BMW’s next-gen eDrive system, the possibility of inductive charging, autonomous driving tech and gesture-based iDrive functions, and the G30 5 Series will be the forefront of technology in the segment.""

My advice:

Communicate all your requests in writing up front, and get signed&amp;dated copies of every agreement from the shop. Insist on having any later “additions” cleared in writing as well (it’s your legal right).

Also, identify pressure tactics (“Let’s get this locked in today!”), and insist on sleeping over any decision, i.e. take the unsigned contract home to look it over carefully.

However they disappeared from the U.S. market a long time ago and re-entered around 2012, thus why a lot of people feel like they are a ""new"" brand when they actually have a 70 years old history.

These days the quality of the Tudor watches are fantastic. Case wise they don't use Rolex's 340L top grade stainless steel (almost no one does), but the polish/finish on the case is as good if not better in certain aspect than a Rolex.

See the chamfered edge on the lugs on OP's watch? Even Rolex doesn't do that these days. 

For example look at this Tudor:http://uhrforum.de/attachments/666992d1375866496-tudor-heritage-chrono-blue-ref-70330b-hauch-von-monte-carlo-dsc01191.jpg

As far as process is concerned. Tape off and protect the rest of the surrounding areas leave a small amount of overlap of the old clear. Strip and clean the area with an IPA solution, Gently wet sand with 5000 grit (to promote adhesion), clean the area some more making sure to pick up any excess clear/paint. Spray your first coat of clear (just like with regular paint this should be light) allow the clear to set, Spray your second coat as a normal application. Follow up with again light wet sanding if needed, or just polish if your overlap is very smooth.

1980,BMW,"Same chassis as the normal 2 series... and most likely the 7 speed dual clutch transmission instead of the ZF 8 speed. I HOPE they will use the M3 electric steering rack up front (since it's better than normal BMW electric steering rack)

Aside from that, just got the LSD (optional on the M235i) and wider body kit with what I assume will be wider wheels too.....

Aside from that, unless they develop special suspension for the M2, the suspension will probably just be the same Adaptive suspension available in the 2 series... (1M got M3 suspension since it was literally a straight swap, which this will not be the case for the M2)

It's a step up from the 1M in the power department so I guess there's that. I'm just hopeful it has more road feel.

N55 cars has been dynoing at around 280 whp stock... with intake, dp, and exhaust and tune, you'll be seeing 340-350 whp easy... M235i is pretty much the same when you do the same things so essentially the engine is the same in terms of tuning.

I'm assuming that BMW basically did what most aftermarket modders do and just got bigger intake, DP and exhaust with the M2 ECU tune on the car as far as making power goes to hit that 340-350 whp (since the whp on BMWs are usually only 5-7% or so below the rated power...) so it's really easy to match the M2 in terms of power output... (The N55 PPK usually raises the power up to around 320-330 whp which is far more than what it's rated by BMW)

Having dealt with numerous claims, body shops, and insurance companies (GEICO, Progressive, All State, and USAA), YOU always get to pick the body shop. Your insurance might recommend body shops that are in their system, but the final decision will be yours. 

My recommendation is to take it to a certified BMW body shop. A BMW dealership can point you in the right direction. These shops are certified by BMW and will have the most complete information and proper know-how to work on BMWs. IIRC, most if not all will warrant their work for the life of the vehicle as long as you own it.

Next you need to turn it on, let it get to halfway, then open the bleeder screw on the expansion tank. DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN IT as it's a plastic thread and fucking it up will require replacing the expansion tank.

I'm getting 26.3 mpg on my daily commute at the moment but I can't stop myself from having a blast (I start each week promising to drive more sensibly). It also sounds absolutely awesome (to me anyway), the engine noise was a key thing for me. Obviously can't yet comment on reliability but I've never once had a problem with a 1.

However, this was the car I really wanted having progressing through 1s over the last few years. I would very much like an M4 next so that's my plan.

Also with regards to the mpg - that's not in eco pro, mostly comfort and a few blasts each week into sport, I also put in 1 of every 4 fill ups 'premium fuel' - could be a folly but force of habit as I did experience better MPG on my first 116i.

Also worth noting they've just done a life cycle update on the 1 and it looks quite different. I got one of the last build slots for the 'older' type.

&gt;The m42 engine was also the economy engine...the 318is was advertised as sporty because it came with sport suspension sport seats aero kit alloys 4 wheel discs and a close ratio 5 speed only.

It was a sports model and M42 wasn't considered an economy engine. Just because US and Canada got it as the least powerful model, doesn't mean it wasn't considered a sports car. There is a reason why it is badged as 'is'. Unlike in the US/Canadian market 'is' badge actually meant something. Which is why outside US/Canada 'is' cars were powered by a more powerful DOHC engine. Which is why there is no such thing as E30 325is, E36 325is or E36 328is outside of US/Canada. However, in Europe, you could get a four door E36 318is. The 'is' badge meant that it was powered by the M42/M44 engine.
So yeah, for all intents and purposes 318is was considered a sports car by BMW.

It'll be like driving a new car. 

Also part of your symptoms could be bad alignment but that can go back to the FCABs because with bad FCABs the car cannot be aligns. The steering offset is related to this as well.

This is simply not true. Here is a brochure for the [E30 318is](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9A7RR4FTiB0RlNfdWJaTTdSVHM/view). Now, find me a brochure or a press release for the F30 318i that sounds anything like that E30 brochure.

Also, BMW did build an econobox version of the E30. The 1984-1985 318i was powered by an M10 engine. And trust me, it was not advertised as  ""bred on the race-track"".

&gt;they really didnt make shitty cheap cars until they started making diesels but even still they were more sporty than other brands cheap fwd econoboxes.

It shows how much you don't know. BMW has been building diesels since early 80s.

&gt;and again you dont know what 'is' means. To be clear the difference between a 1991 318i and a 1991 318 is is the seats, suspension, wheels, brakes, sway bars, steering wheel and shifter. they both have the m42. 'is' for the 318 and the 318 only means improved handling braking steering and nicer interior. 

First of all, the biggest difference between 1991 318i and 1991 318is is the amount of doors.
Yes, they are both powered by the M42 engine, but M42 powered four door 318i only exists in the US and Canada. 

&gt; 'is' refers to handling not a performance engine.

Again, you are focusing too much on the US/Canadian market. Like I said before, here the 'is' badge is pretty much meaningless. Here is how it was everywhere else.

E30 318i 2-door (AF51) M40 - 82kw

E30 318is 2-door (AF91) M42 - 102kw

E30 320i 2-door (1141) M20 - 95kw

E30 320is 2-door (AK95) S14 - 141kw

US/Canadian E30 325is is actually a 325i. In fact, it is impossible to tell a 325i from 325is by looking at a VIN. They actually share the same model code and the same VIN range.


Now, lets look at the E36. It is well known, that in the US/Canada 'is' stood for the body style. 'is' - coupe, 'i' - sedan. However, this is not true anywhere else.

E36 318i 4-door (CA31) M40 - 83kw

E36 318is 4-door (CA51) M42 - 103kw

E36 318is 2-door was the only 'is' coupe outside of US/Canada. It was also powered by the DOHC engine. There was no 2-door E36 powered by a SOHC engine. These are the only ""true"" 'is' cars. Also, 318i sedan that we got, was actually called 318is everywhere else due to the engine.

By the way, the 's' thing is also true for diesel models. More powerful versions are known as 'tds', while regular models are known simply as 'td'

&gt;BMW built the 318is to chase the vw gti....another slow but stellar handling car.

Slow accelerating cars can be sports cars too. I bet you are not going to argue that Mazda Miata is not a sports car.

&gt;318is=economy engine plus body kit sweet wheels brakes tires steering suspension shifter and seats 

Sorry, but you have no idea what you are talking about. Yes, we got lucky here in the US/Canada and got the better 4 banger from BMW. We hate it only because cause it is the basic model. However, everywhere else, people adore the M42/M44 engine and BMWs powered by that engine are highly sought after.",1.0

The 3 series is praised for it's balance in addition to it's power delivery but a 3 series with a 3 cylinder is still a sports sedan and can still be optioned with sport seats LSD short shift m-wheels etc. the gti is a hot hatch not a sports car. Stop calling the 318is a sports car, it isn't. Now straight from Hemings:

After “M,” the two most important letters in the performance BMW alphabet are “i” and “s.” The changes signified by those two little letters have never been drastic—they’ve usually been limited to Sport suspension, seats and trim, sometimes different wheels—but they’ve resulted in some of the German manufacturer’s most coveted automobiles.


Is means injected and sporty. All bmw engines are already sporty so the only way to make a better car is make it handle better which the is package does. It doesn't hurt that only coupes got is badges as 2 door cars are usually considered sporty. Stop getting offended by me calling the m42 an economy engine. I already acknowledged every bmw engine except for the shitty diesels are inherently bred from bmw Motorsport experience and likely to give a smooth linear power band something you can't say about a lot of cheaper econobox engines. Just because a few cars models got power bumps with the is badge doesn't diminish the fact that bmw intention were to make a car handle better. You won't find an is car without alloys upgraded suspension and sport seats. You will find an is car with a normal bmw engine. Most is cars didn't have upgraded internals just used an already sporty existing engine and dressed up the rest of the car to math it up and drive better on the road. ",-1.0

&gt;they really didnt make shitty cheap cars until they started making diesels

There is quite a difference between those two statements

&gt;Stop thinking power is what makes it a sports sedan.

Stop thinking that no power makes it a non-sports sedan

&gt; a 3 series with a 3 cylinder is still a sports sedan and can still be optioned with sport seats LSD short shift m-wheels etc.

No, you can not get an LSD for a 3cyl 3 series. Which actually supports my point. Even with all those options F30 318i is not badged an 'is', because it doesn't have a more powerful engine.

&gt;Stop calling the 318is a sports car, it isn't.

You are contradicting yourself. So, all F30s are sports sedans, yet 318is is not a sports car?

That 330i in Adelaide is the car I'm looking at!  I've already got it booked for an independent inspection on Monday but it's not too late to cancel.

I'd be very interested in anything else you can tell me about the car.

When I spoke to the owner he said he'd only had it a year.  If true then it sounds like he's likely completely ignored the maintenance side of things in that time.  While that's not good, if the owner before him took good care of the car then it could still be a good car, just a little overdue for some TLC.  Or is that just wishful thinking on my part?  Is there anything about the car that could indicate it was mistreated for longer than a year or so?

I don't mind putting a few hours into a car to address minor issues and get it up to spec if it's a cheap car to begin with, but obviously I don't want to buy a lemon, and the money I save on the purchase price must still be more than the money needed to get it up to par to make it worthwhile.

What are your thoughts?  Is it still worth me sending a mechanic out there to look at it or should I just walk away?

*They are not.*

from bmw's very own website: MEET THE HEART AND SOUL OF EVERY BMW.

BMW's design language comes to life in each 3 Series model. From the telltale curve of the Hofmeister kink to the sight of the signature kidney grille rising up in a rearview mirror, every element contributes to the distinct look of the world's first, and most popular, sports sedan.


*This is not what you said. Here is your exact quote

a bmw cheap shitty car is still better than most fwd econoboxes. the diesels were definitely made for those concerned about cost and mileage 


*Stop thinking power is what makes it a sports sedan.
Stop thinking that no power makes it a non-sports sedan*


i never said the 318is wasnt a sports sedan. in fact i was the one who corrected you in saying it was when you called it a sports car which it isnt. again its a sports sedan go to bmw.com and see for yourself. they claim to have invented it just like i told you they did. power doesnt make it a sports sedan the handling does i cant believe you think a 9 second small coupe is powerful even for 1991



*No, you can not get an LSD for a 3cyl 3 series. Which actually supports my point. Even with all those options F30 318i is not badged an 'is', because it doesn't have a more powerful engine.
*

it has an electronic limited slip like most modern performance cars like my focus st and the mclaren mp4-12c. If this technology existed back in the e30 generation they would have used it. again cheap shitty econoboxes dont have lsd elctronic or mehcnical, bmw do because they are all inherently sporty as they are the original sports sedan.


Stop calling the 318is a sports car, it isn't.
*You are contradicting yourself. So, all F30s are sports sedans, yet 318is is not a sports car?*


again the 318is is not a sports car neither is an e46 m3 or a 2002 tii or an e21. they are all sports sedans not sports cars. once again go to bmw.com and hop on to the three series page they call it a sports sedan unless its a wagon that makes it a sports wagon 


*The changes signified by those two little letters have never been drastic
Again, this is true for the US market where like a said a bunch of times, 'is' badge was pretty much meaningless.*


if you call a lsd recaro seats sport suspension and bbs alloy wheels meaningless, then youre a moron. people add these features to countless cars when modifying before adding power to get a significantly better car. they are expensive features most add on but bmw saw fit to equip from the factory and they do make the car noticeably sportier.


*No, not only coupes got the 'is' badge. E30 320is and E36 318is are available as sedans.

*I'm not offended by it. I'm saying that you have no idea what was the true meaning of of the M42/M44 engine was.*

the m42 was the base engine bmw used in its small cars. it replaced the m40 which replaced the m10. at the time of production cars with m10 were also considered to have high performance engines as well despite being sohc and only 100 hp. the m42 is not a significant huge massive race spec performance mill you think it was. the m10 on the 2002 with a turbo made 170 hp, way more than the m42 did so were back to my point that every petrol engine bmw makes has a certain performance pedigree built in and the m42 isnt some special race spec engine which transforms the 318 into the 318is. the is comes from the handling traits not its 'massive' lol 1.8 130 hp engine 





*You won't find an is car without alloys upgraded suspension and sport seats.
Sport seats and upgraded alloys were an option on 318is everywhere but US/Canada. But you I encourage you to look up standard equipment on the E30 320is sedan and E36 318is sedan.*

*You will find an is car with a normal bmw engine.
Again, just because US got DOHC engine instead of the SOHC engine that the rest of the world, doesn't make the DOHC engine a ""normal"" engine for BMW.*

the m42 was just as normal as the m10. despite being sohc many people loved the m10 when it was in the 2002 just like people loved the m42 in the 318is both were considered normal aka inherently sporty and not full on insane like the s14 or m10 turbo which were true intense performance mills.",0.0

First of all, not all 'is' cars got LSD as standard, 318is certainly did not. And no BMW had Recaro seats standard. Second, stop with the personal attacks. 'is' badge doesn't signify a different model in the US/Canada. It's just a badge for a package. 

&gt;it has an electronic limited slip like most modern performance cars like my focus st and the mclaren mp4-12c.

You do realize that there is very little, if any, performance gain with eLSD. In fact, D in eLSD is absolutely pointless. eLSD is just a a traction control. With eLSD car applies brakes to the free spinning wheel. With an LSD, clutches force power to the non-spinning wheel.

&gt;i am only talking about the 318is as we have since the beginning stop bringing those cars up this discussion is about the 318is e30 with m42

We are arguing about the 'is' badge.

&gt;the m42 was the base engine bmw used in its small cars. it replaced the m40 which replaced the m10.


For fucks sake, why am I even bothering to argue with you. You are absolutely clueless. M42 did not replace M40. They ran in parallel. M42 powered cars were badged as 'is'. M40 cars were badged as an 'i'. 

&gt;standard equipment on the 320is was sport seats and alloys.

Sport seats and alloys were an option on the 320is sedan. In fact, about 90% of the 320is did no have either of those options.

VIN of a 320is with sport seats and alloy wheels - 0615139

VIN of a 320is without any of those options - 0615022


&gt;standard on the e36 318is was lower m-technic suspension and ventilated discs and abs. 

By the time E36 318is went into production (09/1993), ABS was standard on all E36s. 
It is true about the ventilated front disc brakes. In some markets 318i came with rear drum brakes. However, M42/M44 powered cars all came with front ventilated braked and rear disc brakes.
So, our E36 318i sedan, is identical to the RoW 318is sedan. 

It is not true about the M-Tech suspension though. It was not standard.

Luckily we don't need a roadworthy here in Tas and It's easy to get a car over the pits and registered here.  I've done 2 motorbikes and a car in the last 2 years, never had a single eyebrow raised at a single issue in the 5 minutes the inspection takes.

I might make a few inquires about other cars tomorrow and then decide whether or not to go ahead with the SA inspection depending on how attractive the other cars look.

I noticed that NSW car has been for sale for about 9 months, but also noticed he originally listed it for $27k.. then $25k.. then $23k  No surprise it didn't sell at those prices.  I suspect the owner *might* be his own worst enemy and is scaring people away.  But it's hard to tell from 1500km away.  The car might also just be a problematic dog.

Although the list of replacements/upgrades is long with the NSW car, most of them are very minor.  Some are odd though.  There's 6 items on the list that are just about the door handles!  Not a single thing to do with major mechanical or body items though.  Just little fussy things.  Maybe he just has kids who habitually yank on the door handles?

Notice how *all* the items in the ""major parts replaced"" list are electrical items?  I would bet money that the car had some mysterious ignition fault at some time and they replaced the ignition coils, pulse generators, cam sensor, crank sensor, and knock sensor in an attempt to track down that single problem.  Apart from that the other problems look pretty par-for-the-course and there's nothing of huge concern to me.  It's good that it hasn't had any major mechanical issues.  Clearly something odd happened regarding the electrics though.  I suspect the reason it has the newer iDrive is because the original CCC system got fried and it didn't cost much more to replace it with the newer CIC iDrive.  I'd want to look very closely to make sure the electrics are all 100% now though.  For all I know there might have been a little fire behind the dash which melted a wiring loom together and is destined to cause problems for years to come.

The more I think about that NSW car the more I think it could be either a great car or a terrible car, but unlikely anything in between.

The ""electronic"" diff, when implemented properly ala McLaren, works wonders. The system on the McLaren doesn't just send power to the wheel that's still got grip, it actively ""brake torques"" power to the outside wheel even when both wheels have traction. It's closer to BMW's torque vectoring diff on the X6 than the e-Diff crap on the E9X.

With what McLaren implemented you REALLY don't need a mechanical LSD since the actual eDiff does exactly what a mechanical diff does, but saves weight on all the added clutches and clutch-packs. The only drawback is that you're constantly burning the rear brakes while turning. But brake pad changes are easy and cheap.

again you know jack shit about the e30 318i. both the 1991 318i and the 318is had m42 engines. 

i like how you spout bullshit statistics with nothing to back it up. i instead have facts. heres some literature on the 320is which talks standard features: http://www.bmwmregistry.com/model_faq.php?id=10
sport seats were standard on 2 door models

and heres some literature on the e36 318is: 
http://bmw3series.johnavis.com/blog/661/review-of-bmw-318is-e36-1992-1998/
m technic suspension was standard


ill break it down for you. is means fuel injected and sporty if you compare an i and an is in america you will find the is will probably have bbs wheels disc brakes sport seats a body kit and other upgrades to make it look and drive more sporty. If you want a big increase in power and a race ready experience it better have an M in front of it.

So not only *you* don't know shit about BMW, which I've proven many times by pointing out errors you've made, you resort to ad hominem. Therefore this is my last reply to you.

&gt;recaro seats were an option on
    bmw 2002
    bmw e21
    bmw e30
    bmw e34
    bmw e46

Recaro seats were only an option on E12, [E28 and E30](http://i.imgur.com/0ewka6s.jpg). The seats were discontinued in 1986. And here is a car [with them](http://www.ruylclassics.nl/bmw16.htm)

&gt;The only drawback is that you're constantly burning the rear brakes while turning. But brake pad changes are easy and cheap.

The only drawback? Seriously? Overheating brakes is not an issue, right?

&gt;again you know jack shit about the e30 318i. both the 1991 318i and the 318is had m42 engines. 

In US and Canada, this is true. In the rest of the world, it is not. Like I said before 1991 318i 4-door with M42 was only offered in the US and Canada. And here is a difference between [318i and 318is of the same year](http://i.imgur.com/gh5rcuE.jpg) outside US and Canada

&gt;i like how you spout bullshit statistics with nothing to back it up. i instead have facts. heres some literature on the 320is which talks standard features: http://www.bmwmregistry.com/model_faq.php?id=10 sport seats were standard on 2 door models

I can back up every single fact I provided. Read my post again. 320is *sedan* doesn't have sport seats as standard. I even provided you a VIN so you can look up a build sheet. Pretty factual to me. 

&gt;and heres some literature on the e36 318is: http://bmw3series.johnavis.com/blog/661/review-of-bmw-318is-e36-1992-1998/ m technic suspension was standard

That being said, I think part of it stems from the idea that they come here and enjoy the best lifestyle and education money can buy while the majority of America is struggling to pay its bills. They come for a few years, live in the lap of luxury just to leave and contribute nothing back. I know there's no rule to prevent them doing this, and I wouldn't want there to be one, but I'm still human and it's irritating nonetheless, especially when our own students are putting themselves into massive debt to go to school.

Part number for that cover should be 51437022393 (pre 09/2003) or 51437151301 (post 09/2003) if you want to do additional searches, but it should be pretty straightforward once you see the grooves.

Price is about 6-8k for something with decent mileage, in top top shape and everything. Not to mention still a bmw with premium costs. LS power?

3267,BMW,"&gt;When your friends and coworkers driving Lambo or Ferrari, they will not be shinny cars, they will become normal car that every one have, and you will be the special one if you don't have one.

We call that ""Keeping up with the Jonses"" here.

If people would judge you based on the value of your car, clothes, etc, than they're a materialistic piece of shit that isn't worth your time anyway.

I could sympathize if you had said you and your friends were buying these cars because you genuinely like them and appreciate exotic motorsports, but you're buying them just to show off your money for the sake of fitting in. Spending hundreds of thousands and/or millions of dollars of your parent's money to show off is the epitome of what people don't like about these kids.

First, imagine you as a normal 16 years old teenager travel all the way to a new world across the Pacific Ocean, without your parents, no way of communication, different culture, different everything, to live, to study. Everything is a challenge, you need to find a place to live, then open electricity, internet, gas, cell phone plan, a car, etc. Along, without knowing how to speak English and how American works. Even with bags load of money, I was crying everyday and trust me, I'm not a weak person. Now imagine you have to go through everything in high school like that and get accept in those top 100 University or our parents wouldn't think we are worth to stay here(all Asian parents are same, if we don't get A we are fucked). Friends are our family, we study together, play together, we don't need to show off to each other, our relationship are more than that. I love cars, not just car itself, but the culture, and car people are the easiest to talk to. But some of my friends have no interest for them, they might like watches, or fashion, or night clubs, so when they want to get a car, they will ask me and I will give them suggestions. If I drive a M3 I will just suggest them to get a C63 or similar, so we can have different cars to drive, but not jump out from the rest. Don't give me wrong, we all can afford something much better, and I know few person had LP700 or F12. They buy C63 not because it's flashy or showoff, they buy it because they don't want to buy a Ferrari to grab too much attention from new freind that just meet us, and C63 or M3 for us just like a Corolla for normal person. Just like if your neighbors all driving Camry you don't want to drive a M6 or a 1000 dollars honda, you will get a Camry too. Please respect different people will have different living standard, just like those poor kids in Africa will think have running water to take shower or eat three times a day is outrageous and wasteful.

3280,BMW,"Like I said before, you seem like a nice person, and I appreciate you taking the time to elaborate your point of view. I traveled a lot growing up, but also didn't get along with my parents very well, so the idea of being sent to another country to study with all my friends with an endless supply of money sounds like a dream come true. 

I've always been pretty independent, but I can understand how it would be extremely hard for most kids to be so far away from their families. I also understand what you're saying about standards of living, and don't want to sound bitter or envious of your lifestyle. Most of my immediate family are either well-off or obscenely wealthy, so I know what it's like to maintain a certain expectation of what you should do and how to be. 

I guess a lot of my point of view is that despite having money, my family always maintained a very low-key lifestyle. My father's parents struggled through the Great Depression, so there's something oldschool instilled in him about saving money. It's not to say we didn't live a good life, but you can believe every non-essential expense was carefully planned and thought out. To this day my parents drive Camry-ish cars, despite my dad's secret yearning to own a 2 seater sports car (that he could totally afford). It's just how he is, and a bit of it rubbed off on me too.

Anyway, I hope you don't take anything I've said personally. I don't begrudge someone owning an M3 or C63, and wouldn't really classify them as flashy exotics. The kids I'm referring to are the entitled ""princes"" and ""princesses"" driving LaFerarri's and McLarens, acting a fool in public as if everyone should bow to their demands. If you're not one of those kids, then you have nothing to worry about. I may raise an eyebrow, but I won't judge a person's character by the things they own, but on how they act.

I will say one last thing however, if all my neighbors had a Camry, I'd still have my BMW because I love it and could care less what everyone else has. It's a little funny because most of my neighbors call me ""The BMW guy"" and a couple guys come chop it up with me sometimes about cars.

You know, my dad actually lived and traveled through China to study Mandarin after college, and I always thought that was awesome. To be honest, I probably would've loved it, but then again I've always liked asian culture, food and without sounding like a white guy stereotype, the women as well. My longtime girlfriend is Vietnamese but was born here. She keeps her roots though, and most of her family is still oldschool Vietnamese and Cantonese that came on the boats after Saigon. 

I'm a little different than a lot of white people in that regard that I understand asian cultures and traditions a little better, so I understand where you're coming from when you talk about being isolated. I guess one way to put it in perspective is that for an American, seeing a young kid with an exotic car their parents bought is similar to your comparison of having a BMW instead of a Camry in China. It's a slap in the face to the people who are trying to live modest lives.

A modern diesel car engine's torque curve will be fairly flat, with a tail off towards 4500-5000rpm or so, and then by the calculations the horsepower will be increasing with engine rpm.

You definitely get more power by revving the engines higher, albeit not to the extent of a petrol engine. So you might as well do it. Even if you could get roughly the same power output by changing gear, you not only save time by not changing gear, but also ensure the turbo is spinning as quickly as possible when you do change.

The thermostat is cheap and easy enough to do that unless it's already stuck open I'd leave it alone.

It's *possible* that your cooling fan hasn't run in a while and you didn't notice because you weren't in traffic in high temps, and that your water pump failing led to a coolant temperature spike that blew up the ET, but I'd consider that very unlikely. Depending on mileage and replacement history they might (along with all hoses) simply be due.

I have done quite a bit of autox and played my fair share of racing sims so I think I was more prepared than most first timers.

When my instructor went silent on the 4th session I got a little sloppier but I also had been relying on him to memorize all my cues for me so I sharpened up again after a few laps. He still said I could sign up as intermediate and drive without an instructor at my next event.

3573,BMW,Saw one on the wild today... Wow! ,1.0
3574,BMW,"I saw an E34, 520i, Made in 02/88 in the Junkyard last weekend. The rear-end in this particular car had an e28 style rear subframe. Very weird early production stuff. The doors had covers on them for window crank, with unique cable driven window motors going to the cranks. 

The early (&lt;'90ish) E34s, esp the 520s had more primitive wiring. Look at the instrument cluster and see if it has an analog or digital odometer, signifying whether you have the ""HI"" or ""LO"" wiring installed in the car. If you have LO wiring, you may not be able to retrofit many options such as the OBC later on.

This particular 520i, E34, made in 02/88 was a European market one (here in Canada) that someone must've imported. It's hard to say how much of it was early production weirdness, but I would recommend getting an e34 made after 1990. 

I have a 92 525i with the M50, pre-vanos. It's nice for power, with pretty much nothing below 3000rpm, then the power band hits you. My dad's '87 E28 535i is much torquier (and it's also a lighter car). I haven't driven an E34 535i or a 520i. I can't really imagine the downgrade going from an M50 to an M20 525i, let alone the 520i. The M50 525i is a zippy car, but you really have to rev a lot to get into the power band. 

I have driven a '91 M5 once. That car was stupid fast. 70kph -&gt; 150kph on a 4-3 downshift before I even looked down at the speedo. It'll rev all day. 

I also drove an 88 Alpina B10 3.5 once. (One of 512 made). Very nice balance. It's like a 535i but with more grunt. Much different character than the M5. ",1.0

I'm comfortable doing that install myself - it doesn't look too difficult - but I'm not so comfortable drilling/mounting the actual aux jack.  I want a pro to do it so it looks like a pro install.  If I put it in cockeyed, it will haunt me the rest of the life of the vehicle.  Besides, he quoted me at $80 labor, so that's worth it to me.

I *would* get the navigation system, but I don't like in-car nav systems.  Most of them don't update for traffic in real time like my iPhone apps do.  I thought about getting something like the [Oxygen Audio](http://www.amazon.com/Oxygen-Audio-iPhone-Docking-Receiver/dp/B006JXRE4M) head unit that is designed to work with iPhones, but then my phone isn't really in a good spot for viewing navigation directions.

I ordered the aux jack off Amazon this morning.  It's only $36.  I'm thinking of mounting it in the dash-top box facing away from the driver so it can't be seen.  That way, I can just plug in my audio cable and mount my iPhone to the dash on top of the flip up panel and run a flat audio cable through the rear crack of the dash box lid.  The dash box itself will hold the cable.  I might have a usb power adapter put in there as well if it's possible, or I might just run the cable behind the dash faceplates up to the dashtop box.

As for the headlights, that's definitely something I'm not prepared to do.  I read the instructions online and it seems to be a lot of wiring.  I'm not 100% sold on the Oracle headlights yet, but if I have to start cutting &amp; splicing wires, that's about the time I call someone.

If you want reliability, the E30 may be the best 3-Series yet. The E30 simply had very little to go wrong, inherently making it a more reliable car. I have several friends who have the 318 model and they absolutely love it.

If you want performance, the F30 is the best then. To put things in perspective, a 1988 E30 M3 took 6.9 seconds to get to 60 mph and ran the 1/4 mile in 15.2 seconds at 92 mph. The new F30 BMW 328i does the 0-60 run in 5.8 seconds and the 1/4 mile in 14.1 seconds.

As the owner of an E46, theres no fucking way I would label it as the best.

I like my E46, it's been great. It still is a BMW, has that BMW driving feel, but that car was neutered.

Reasons:

1. No LSD and no easy LSD swap option. This is the main reason the E46 was neutered from the beginning. E30s and E36s both have LSD as an option while the E46 gets stuck with a one wheel peel coupled with cheap wheel speed sensors that fail often and are hard to replace.

2. Got fatter with not much bump in power (excluding ZHP). The V6 Camry of that era were faster than E46s. The M52/54TU (TU=technical update) engines added dual vanos and a few other fancy things, but power was not much higher than the E36 which weighed less.

3. My 5 speed transmission is sloppy. It is no where near my Miatas 5 speed.


The e30 is brilliant, however the E36 is just as good, with more power, luxury, comfort and safety.

3910,BMW,"In the UK it's a little like this:

(this is my local area)

'Panda' Cars, these are the cars that are for your standard police officers to patrol the streets of city centres and the surrounding areas, the drivers do have minor (compared to 'Traffic Officers' - more on them later) pursuit training but they're mainly first line response. 

You often find them in diesel hatchbacks, round here it's Hyundai i30 Estates and the odd Focus estate. Very rarely (round here at least) they'll pull out a larger estate car such as a Mondeo estate to setup checkpoints and the like.

Now, on our motorways (our version of the freeway) we have what're called 'Traffic Police', they are specifically sent to deal with everything vehicle related such as motor accidents and their main task is to patrol the motorways. These guys have a tonne of training and have to of been in the force for at least two years iirc. They get all sorts of special cars. In the past ten years in our local area they've had:

- Volvo V70 T5 estates
- Vauxhall Vectra Turbos
- Land Rover Discoveries
- BMW X5s
- E39 and E60 530i's with some forces having 535d's
- More recently E90 330 and 335i's and d's
- And their newest seems to be the Skoda Octavia VRS.

On top of this various forces up and down the country have used EVOs and WRX STi Imprezas.

They tend to give the faster vehicles to special pursuit branches or to the forces in areas with common car crimes to quickly catch the crims and to me this makes most sense, be useless having a Hyundai that tops out at 110 chasing a 150mph BMW...

Although, compared to how it was in the 80s and 90s (I'm talking Ford Cosworth's and the like...) the police rely a lot more on the helicopter doing most of the work.

HTH! :)

Look, I see from other posts that you're 17 and you think you're going to land a decent job.  That's all well and fine, but let me tell you something as someone who has been in your shoes.  Do not blow tons of money on cars until you're making at least six figures a year.  Given the uncertainty of the economy these days (another bubble is right around the corner), you should save M4 money and split the difference towards an entry BMW.  Or get an older one that has a few years of solid depreciation and put the difference towards retirement.  I know, crazy talk from a crazy ""old"" dude.

I digress...but, her [435](http://imgur.com/a/IfFoU) is a lease, so I didn't bother going with different tires. She only has 10K miles, so the tires are holding up so far, and she doesn't drive it very hard (in spite of all of my encouragement to do so!). However, I always, always, always swap out the RFTs for standard tires on my cars. Ignoring any wear issues, I have had blowouts on 3 tires when hitting relatively minor potholes. Also, the ride is very stiff with the RFTs. And, as you said, they are not cheap to replace. I just risk it with standard tires, since I would be out of luck if I got a flat. But, I'd rather risk the flat (and I haven't had a single flat with standard tires) vs. using RFTs that tend to self destruct! I did keep the 19s with the RFTs for winter use, or just as a backup, if necessary. OK...I'll shut up about RFTs now. :)

Their recommendation is to turn off the AC a minute or two before shutting the car off.  I find that works quite well.  (I have 150k on my e39, all my miles)  What also works is just always leaving the AC on.  The smell only seems to be a problem if the AC isn't on.

4232,BMW,"///M-car parts are generally more expensive and you'll have 2 extra cylinders to take care of. As a general rule in car buying, less cylinders are cheaper to maintain than more. The e46 had a rod bearing recall done on it that was the biggest problem that comes to mind, although most of the e46's still on the road have had that recall service performed. Can't speak too much on the e46's, but the 335i is my dream care after I graduate, so I've been researching them for quite a while now.

335i's have a handful of reliability issues, mainly the HPFP, turbo wastegates, and water pump. A lot of the issues were resolved after 2007 when BMW worked out a lot of the kinks in the turbos. However, without upgrading the turbos (check out RBTurbo in St.L), you'll always have the possibility of wastegate issues/rattling. Shoot for something that has had them replaced before, as the warranty on them expires at 82k. The 335i HPFP is notorious as well, but those are warrantied to 120k. It's not uncommon for people to recommend getting CPO 335i's as that can save you a lot of headaches if something is wrong. CPO aside, finding detailed service history on either of these cars is going to be crucial.

Final note is that knowing how to turn a wrench will save you a lot of money with either of these cars. The water pump on the 335i for example, goes out often but is pretty cheap/easy to replace yourself if you're willing to get your hands a little grubby.

4881,BMW,"Whats your budget?

I owned a E87 120d Auto. It was nippy. But it was a pain to live with every day. Very uncomfortable, due to the very stiff suspension and the fact that no 1 series has lumbar support. The sound proofing is pretty bad, especially with the diesel, it gets loud.
The engine bay is so compact, its a pain to carry out any maintenance. The back end slips all the time. I fitted 4x new Michelin Primacy 3 tyres, and after 3-4k miles on them, the back stars to slip in either straight line or corner acceleration. I've lost it 3-4 times coming out of roundabout or turning off a road.
The facelift model, has start/stop that can be annoying and will put more wear on the starter .
Also the rear seats... Pretty limited. A adult will not sit there comfortably plus BMW use this age old trick of cutting the back seat short. So there is no thigh support either.
Plus in the UK they are mostly owned by youths who don't look after them as they should.


In terms of Petrol vs Diesel. The engine line up on the e87 is limited. Essentially all the petrol powered cars are gutless/unreliable and thirsty. The best delivery of sport and economy is the 120d.  However if you want some speed go for the 130i. But if you are also concerned with economy then the 123d delivers the most power/to mpg ratio and with a remap it be pretty impressive. ",1.0

Most sites that are submitted usually have a mix of submitters. For example, here is your [submission history](http://i.imgur.com/Hw8YGVO.jpg). When I look at the domains like [topspeed.com](https://www.reddit.com/domain/topspeed.com/), [autoblog.com](https://www.reddit.com/domain/autoblog.com/), [carscoops.com](https://www.reddit.com/domain/carscoops.com/), and [gtspirit.com](https://www.reddit.com/domain/gtspirit.com/) in the domain search, you see that there is a mix of submitters for all those car sites. The site has a real audience that likes to share their content. However, I can understand, this might be a new site, still building their audience, that's why only one person submits content. 

But when I looked at thesportscarguys.com domain [sub history](https://www.reddit.com/domain/thesportscarguys.com/), almost 90% of the submissions are from you. Also, looking through that, I came across this account /u/Carluvr (weird coincidence both accounts spell Luvr the same, but it happens) and /u/dukeelington. I took peek at their submissions histories ([1](http://i.imgur.com/MjOXFzw.jpg),[2](http://i.imgur.com/Xon8X9W.jpg)), and noticed both had submitted content from this blog (making up the missing 10%), and they have one other site in common they both submitted.

That site is WastingTimeGames.com, which has weirdly similar theme, but maybe just another coincidence. However, I noticed the same trend, only two accounts (the ones I noted above) submitted from that domain. And it's strange that only other accounts that submitted this blog, happen to submit similar things (I want call them white labeled submissions - meaning domains that don't raise a flag and make self promotion obvious), and weirdly share submissions from one random blog. 

Again, a lot of coincidences but it can happen. So, I decided to do a domain search to find the owner of and IP of each site. Lo and behold, WastingTimeGames.com and TheSportsCarGuys.com are on the same address. If the site is using shared hosting, normally it should have the same domain. Again, it can happen. I decided to look at each sites Whois ([1](http://www.tcpiputils.com/browse/domain/thesportscarguys.com), [2](http://www.tcpiputils.com/browse/domain/wastingtimegames.com)) and both are registered to the same org (Wasting Time Games). One is owned by person named David, and the other is owned by a person named Heather but they share the same last name. David appears on the blog's about page: http://thesportscarguys.com/about/. So, it looks like David owns both sites, that happen to only be submitted by those 2 accounts and you.

Still, I wanted to make sure I was making the right decision. So I went through all of your posts to see which author you submitted the most, and it happen to be David. There were too many coincidences to give you the benefit of the doubt at this time, so I went ahead and removed your post. 

I hope that explains where I am coming from. If you are the person who owns, or works for these sites, we do allow self promotion once you have become an active, contributing member. We can discuss it further in [PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FBMW) if you like. If not, and I am mistaken, please continue to submit content, just not from this domain. We appreciate your cooperation in keeping /r/BMW promotion free.

1 - Where in Europe are you moving to? Some of the northern countries (such as Norway) have a law stating that you need a set of winter tyres to swap into.  It's a rear drive car, so will be a bit sketchy when the snow falls, but decent tyres will keep you safe.

2 - When the service indicator tells me to!  You get an indicator saying how many miles/time it is until the next item needs to be looked at.  Try and keep oil changes to every 10k miles at the most.  It's not called an oil burner for nothing, and infrequent oil changes will do the most damage.

3 - Yes!  Although I had to trade in my Alpina D3 BiTurbo (some rubbish about buying a house, I forget ;) but it has 143-bhp and due to motorway miles achieves 57.6 mpg as fuel economy.  If you're of a mind, it can be remapped as well, potentially getting up to 180-bhp for plenty of fun times!

It's hard to know whether it's worth it to get an aftermarket warranty or not. The big ticket items/common failures are:

* Rod bearings. Usually results in needing a new motor. Getting the rod bearings done at an indy shop would run roughly $3k.

* Throttle actuators. There are two of these and cost roughly $900 each. They don't normally both fail at the same time.

* AC Evaporator. The part is relatively cheap but is very labor intensive. Dealerships charge roughly $3k for the parts and labor.


If none of those items have been replaced, it may be worth it to get an aftermarket warranty, but make sure these items are covered. Sometimes at this mileage, they only cover the powertrain. I took a gamble and didn't purchase an extended warranty after my BMW warranty ran out and luckily haven't have any big issues.


I've only had extensive driving time with the E60 M5 and the E46 M3. The E60 M5 is a beast but drinks gasoline like nobody's business.

5282,BMW,"FWIW BMW/Castrol TWS was never ""just rebranded"" when castrol was going to stop making that formulation of oil BMW's M division struck an exclusivity deal with Castrol to keep making it but exclusively distributing it through BMW and with the BMW labeling. Which is to say for about 5 years BMW/Castrol labeled TWS was the only was to purchase that formulation of oil. Later it was rebranded into the non-BMW Edge 10w-60.

So, it would be more accurate to say that Castrol Edge 10w-60 is rebranded TWS with some douchiness removed ;)

It's also worth noting that BMW no longer calls for TWS in any of it's M cars and the S65 powered E9x M3 now calls for Shell M-twin Power 10w60; however it isn't clear if this is a rebranded existing formulation or a new formulation made for BMW.",2.0

This sounds more like someone drove the car and ran over a curb or something.  A car in a metal shipping container would have to have been dropped from a great height to damage the frame and, miraculously, not damage anything else.  The car's suspension would have likely absorbed the brunt of the impact.  Damaged suspension components can cause these same issues, so do not immediately assume it's frame damage.  Take the car to a place that does frame alignments to see if the frame is truly out-of-spec.  They'll be able to surmise a better idea about what probably happened.  Tell-tale signs of curb damage would be quite visible when the car is up on a lift.  Torn strut towers would be a likely obvious sign of the car having received too much stress when being dropped.  Again, that's why I think this car was seriously curbed at one point... replacing some of the suspension components is probably all that's needed.  

Also, the resale value of the car is only cut in half if the car receives a salvage or rebuilt title.  If the accident wasn't reported then the title remains as clean.  This is why cars that were in an accident and maintained a clean title are lucrative for resellers.  ",5.0

5714,BMW,"I just bought a 330ci today! Good luck. 

$7,500 seems like way too much. I paid $1k less than that for a car with less mileage and that had been excessively well maintained. Here's what you should check for. 

At 100k the cooling system needs to be replaced. This is a huge preventative maintenance item that can otherwise end in disaster. Check the radiator, reservoir, and hoses. If the owner hasn't had this worked on or replaced it himself, you're going to have to. This is probably the biggest item specific to the E46 compared to other cars. 

Check also for control arm issues. The bushing tends to wear out and could need replacement. You can check for control arm problems by kicking the front tires and seeing if they wobble. While driving, apply brake firmly and suddenly and see if the steering wheel jerks at all. If it does, there's a problem. 

While the car is running, adjust the vents in the center of the dash to full heat to verify you don't smell any oil burning. You could have a leaking gasket if this is the case. 

Beyond that, there isn't much more to investigate specifically on the 330. If it's a manual, make sure the clutch isn't shot. If it's auto, make sure to test sport and manual mode. Check all interior and exterior lights, along with window operation and window seals (beware of dry and cracked seals). I got a coupe so I'm not familiar with the roof system, but definitely make sure it's not having any issues. Check the brakes (I brought calipers in order to see how thin the rotors and pads were), check for engine codes with a scan tool, verify that the power seats work as they should, and rev it in neutral to listen for any ticking sounds or abnormalities. 

For $7,500, this car should be pretty damn near perfect. Check all his maintenance documentation, you should be seeing regular oil changes at the least. Look carefully around the interior to see if it's beat up. Just looking for the frequency of scratches and amount of wear on the center console will tell you a lot about how someone cares for their car. Good luck!",1.0

As with any car, I tell someone to take the time to drive and learn their car and be conservative. I had plenty of Mustangs and other muscle cars try and challenge me and they are astonished that a little BMW can hold toe (or if you're going through a turn) leave them behind. I went from a Ford Crown Victoria (aka american police cruiser) to the Z4 and while I was used to the power, not the handling. Don't turn the DTC off until you really know what you're doing.

At least where I live, my options for maintenance are a little limited and owning a BMW in general is going to be 2x or 3x more than something like a Ford. The Z series are sports cars and do share components with other BMWs, but you'll find oddities (for example, the front badge is bolted to the front bumper, where as all others, is attached to the hood. I had to pay two hours of labor to replace the $30 front hood badge :( ) and it's going to cost just to even replace the brakes or tires. I think my yearly cost was around $4,000 / year for brakes, oil changes, and tires, which as a daily driver, I was going through. Until I moved 18 blocks from my office, I would put 20,000 miles on my car a year.

My other advice to think about when looking at a roadster, especially the Z series or Miata, they are very close to the ground and when used as a daily driver, are going to wear on your knees. Even my SO, who is 5'3, was starting to get tired of getting out of such a low car. I would advice against a Z for a daily driver without something like a lil' pickup truck or SUV for an alternative.

Roadsters are like nothing else to drive and for everything you put into them, you'll get that much more fun out of it. I don't regret selling mine, because it wasn't very practical and was causing me back and knee issues, but I will get another in a few years when I can afford it as a weekend car.",1.0

Pretty straight forward process, and you can find tutorials everywhere online, but this is what I did:

* **(1)** Covered the rotors and calipers with garbage bags (split them along the seam to create sheets of plastic, which I could thread through the spokes and wrap around the brakes).
* **(2)** Cleaned each wheel twice with a few microfiber towels and [a wax and grease remover](http://shop.advanceautoparts.com/p/duplicolor-grease-wax-remover-32-oz.-quart-cm543/10675396-P). I spent ~20min each wheel all told.
* **(3)** Apply two thin coats of Plasti Dip to all four wheels (allowing 15-20min to dry between coats).
* **(4)** Roll car forward or back enough to rotate the wheels ~1/3rd. This allows you to get at different parts of the wheel which were out of reach before.
* **(5)** Repeat Step 3
* **(6)** Apply three heavy coats (allowing 15-20min to dry between coats).
* **(7)** Peeled the Plasti Dip off the BMW logo.

I goofed a couple times on the early coats, where I got too close and laid down a heavy line, or was a little uneven. In the end though, by the 7th coat almost all my mistakes were covered up.

All told I'm really happy with how it turned out.

This was the woman's 3rd DUI.... Yeah. She refused a breathalyzer and fled the hospital before a blood draw. When she was arrested at her home half a year later, she assaulted the cop.

After being interviewed by 3 or so attorneys who represented the state—each one seemingly fresh out of law school, and doing their stint before a real job—eventually a new attorney gave her a plea bargain.

The speed limit on the road was 40-ish, but I was likely doing well below that. Being on the road that early and then seeing another car, I actually slowed down, and was suspicious. She turned into me at the last second, like she intended to hit me. 

Every body panel on the car was twisted—even the trunk had damage when I looked at it.

That's not where they're making their money, yet they still offer driver vehicles, probably because of the halo effect. They can do one of two things: offer vehicles that compromise to attract large portions of the market, or offer niche cars that DO NOT compromise to attract smaller portions of the market. Obviously these niche cars have to use shared platforms. Either way, BMW is doing an amazing job at what they're supposed to do, making money for their stock holders.

I signed up for the autocross event, got to drive 2 laps in a 328d and 3 laps in a 428i, also sat in on the laps of 2 other people, while getting instructions and tips from professional drivers (mine had 21 years of F1 and rally experience). Was also able to take a 650i convertible out for a solo street drive (~10 min), no employees, just me and my brother. They have at least one or two cars from every currently available series for you to take on the roard... except the i8 and M's :( 

They also had a 535i on a skid pad with soapy water to show how their traction control works, and an X5 on a mountain climbing exercise (you can see this in the album). 

The autocross was incredibly fun, and you get a timed run after a couple of laps in each car. You also get about 45 min of instruction prior to getting in the cars, so you can get the most out of it if you haven't done autocross before.

6591,BMW,"There are a lot of things to watch out for, but you're fairly safe getting an M54-powered car, as you are.

On our engines (M45B30 in the 530i, M54B25 in the 525i, etc.), there are three major oil leak locations—valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket (not the gasket that's replaced with oil changes, this is a different one, and is a couple hours of labor to replace), and the crankcase vent system (CCV), which fails often in cold climates. However, once these are done, you're generally good for a long time.

Check power steering lines. On one of my cars, they leaked onto the alternator. That was fun. There can also be other miscellaneous power steering leaks, but a well-kept car will have had an owner who stays on top of that, just as they would the oil leaks.

Cooling system components should have a refresh at 100k, but not everyone is wiling to do this. So ask for receipts or proof, and watch out for a car where the cooling system tanks and lines look brittle.

The automatics are fine transmissions, but all autos will fail eventually. My auto has 142k and the transmission feels great, but I don't know what that means. My manual car, however, is much, *much* more fun, and has all the other benefits of a stickshift.

With those earlier mechanical points aside, they are very reliable cars if you stay on top of maintenance and don't let things pile up. They're also great cruisers (although they could use a sixth gear...) and make for great, comfortable, but reasonably fun daily drivers. And thank you for not looking for a V8.

The M54 is arguably one of the best engines BMW has ever made. There may be oil leaks but that could just be because there is *a lot* of oil in the car. Also, as my previous car was a Volvo 240 that basically bled oil, I wasn't too worried.

Off the bat I had to replace 2 control arms but that was fine, potholes are a bitch. The biggest worry I had was the VANOS system but I have had no problems with that. My second biggest worry was the cooling system, but the water pump was fairly new and again, I had no problems. I used the OBD2 code reader for most things and it did a good job.

* The rear bumper has a black or dark accent piece that should exist where the dimples are

Here's a video that shows it in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylqb4cDWMsE 

The numbers at the bottom from left to right tell you how many degrees your leaning front/back (1 degree in your pic's case), the grade the road is (2%) and how much you're leaning side-to-side (2 degrees). From the looks of the model, you're leaning back that 1 degree and to the right 2 degrees. Go on rough terrain and you'll see it really move.

That's really the best you can do in this case. What I would do though—and what I did for my E24, which I bought in West Virginia when I was living in Vermont—is drive the car back, not ship. This way, even if it costs a lot to bail out and travel back home, you can still enter into the physical purchase process with the idea that you don't *have* to buy the car. You most likely will buy the car, especially if it checks out, but this way both you and the dealer understand that no one's been swindled into purchasing anything, and the condition can be examined fairly.

With the E9X M3 platform, the coupe outsold the sedan a bajillion to one (not confirmed). Point being, the coupe sold like hotcakes whereas BMW had a hard time getting sedans off the lot.

Because of that, BMW adjusted their expectations and gave more M4 (coupe) allocations as opposed to the M3 since they weren't expecting sales. Well, for some reason, the M3 sedan has been extremely popular. Demand has been extremely high, yet BMW didn't give enough allocations to dealers to order the M3s. M4s are still selling much better (2:1 as /u/sigckfinga mentioned), but that ratio is still a lot higher than it was for the E9X.

Simply put, BMW hasnt been making enough M3s. They can, but they just haven't. It's been an EXTREME pain in the ass to order one, since not many dealers have any allocations to put an order in for MY2015. I have been calling dealers around the country to get an order in. Dealers either can't put an order in, or they do haven an allocation, but won't budge from MSRP. I really do hope that BMW gets their shiet together and make sure there are a lot more allocations for the sedans. I'm on the waitlist for a MY2016 and only hoping an allocation opens up for a June order so I can get my car before the summer is over. MY2015 is not that different from the facelift. Id just rather have my car sooner and i won't be crying over the rear LED taillights, not to mention May's rates are totally awesome compared to the crappy numbers Mercedes Benz gives out (I've been cross shopping with the C63 AMG).

My calculations or figures may be off, but from your pictures those wheels look a tad too large, so I ran the numbers for your rear tires and a stock E46 setup (205/50/R17).

Your setup appears to have a total outside diameter of 641.6mm, while the stock setup appears to be 636.8mm. So if those are correct, that could definitely be the source of your occasional rubbing. Definitely throw the stock wheels on at least to see.

EDIT: Your front setup is 647.1mm, according to the figures above. ಠ_ಠ

FWIW, BMW speedometers have a built in positive margin of error (as practically all do), so the larger wheels may have inadvertently made the speedometer more accurate.

Those wheels definitely do look too large. I'd stick with 18s and check with Tire Rack, forums, or a tire size calculator (also, check my numbers on a tire size calculator as well haha) to make sure you get an outside diameter equal to the stock wheels. I know a lot of people tend to think bigger is better when it comes to wheels, but honestly, bigger just looks silly and is a pain in the ass to manage (as you now know). If you must run massive wheels and tires, you'll want to roll your fenders, which will also probably help in the meantime (or if the stock tires have issues as well).",3.0

You're right.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's already sold.  E34's are pretty easy to work on and don't need a lot of regular maintenance beyond the typical BMW things - you know this from your experience with your E92!  Cooling system, oil changes, brakes, etc.  It's all going to depend on what kind of work has been done by the previous owners.  If there's no history or knowledge about what's been done then it's a gamble.  The car is worth the money even without service history - if it starts fine, drives and doesn't make weird sounds/noises, just buy it.  Watch the temp gauge and let the car idle for at least 10 minutes (after it's been properly warmed-up) for a rough cooling system test.

It's also worth checking to see if it's necessary to do a valve adjustment. But taking it to a trusted independent mechanic whom you know well would be a good call.

The car will also need a walnut blasting almost immediately. 

Ballpark $15k-$17k with that mileage depending on the year and condition. E90 6MT are rareish in the states, so if its in good shape, you've found something special. Not that it is more valuable because of that, though. I paid just over $20k for my 2007 with 21k miles last year.",2.0

If you know someone who works at a BMW dealer- try a local BMW owner Facebook group, e90post or bmwcca, they can look up the car by it's VIN to see what warranty work has been done. 
 
As far as prices go, you didn't say what year which also makes a big difference - 2010s and up 335i have a different engine (n55) than the 2007-2010 model (n54), which is somewhat more reliable but less tunable.  

Depending on location and year, I don't think 14-15k is unfair a price.  Especially if it has sport package.

Anyway. You need to wet sand it out.  Start with 400 grit wet sanding paper and wet sand until you remove all the damage and the light is a nice uniform shade of opaque finish. You need to make sure you remove all the damage with the 400 grit or lower. Make sure to keep spraying with water. 80 percent of your sanding should be spent on the lowest grit removing the damage. The rest of it is just buffing with finer and finer grade of micromesh. Rinse off with water when done and apply wax when finished and buff wax to shine.

7658,BMW,"Yeah, depending on the dealership, Dinan does void the BMW warranty. They just replace it with their own warranty.

They cover the remainder of the 4 year/50k mile factory warranty (whatever the factory doesn't cover) and/or 2 years/unlimited miles on their part.

Basically, if you bought a 3 year old used car and got a Dinan part, they would cover whatever was voided for the 1st year and the only cover their part for the 2nd year.

TLDR: It's not worth it to buy Dinan parts for the warranty in most situations because of the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act.

Best time to get a Dinan is when you buy the car new because you'll get 4 years of coverage of the increased performance and wear and tear on the car. If you buy it after the 4 year/50k warranty expires, it's the same as buying any other tune/aftermarket part.",1.0

",2.0
7670,BMW,"The other posters nailed it. Just for clarification: an M car is a version of a standard BMW that has been almost totally redesigned by BMW Motorsport. These cars don't have ""normal"" BMW model names like 325i or 540i or Z4. Rather, they have an M right in the model name like M3, M5, Z4M, or X5M. These real M cars have significant differences in every aspect of the car, from appearance to powertrains. They will also have very distinct VINs relative to the non-m versions.

On the other hand, BMW also offers an M package for a lot of their regular lineup. The M package usually is mostly composed of slightly more aggressive bodywork, usually some fancier interior bits (steering wheel), and sometimes some performance parts like exhaust. These M package cars are still not true M cars, as they are still much more similar to the regular model than they are to an M car. Your car, being a 325i, is a regular BMW 3 series with an M package. Its characteristic of the M package to have a ton of little M badges all over the car, which is obviously confusing to those less familiar with BMWs.",2.0
7671,BMW,do you like driving manuals lol.,1.0
7672,BMW,"I just went through this research myself for my 2012 335i (F30 N55).  I'm pretty sure the 535i (F10) has the same engine, so all this will apply the same to your 535i.

Regarding warranties, a Dinan tune will void the BMW warranty.  However, Dinan offers a matching warrant themselves which covers everything BMW would have.  However, this is only for the factory warranty.  If you have an extended warranty or a CPO warranty, Dinan does not match these. The only tune that will not void your warranty is the BMW performance package (PPK).

With previous BMW engines, the best tune was always a chip tune.  Unfortunately, BMW has seriously upped their game on encrypting the DME (the car's computer), so software chip tunes are currently impossible.  That means your only option is for a piggyback tune (which basically means all you can do is play with the boost levels).  Pretty much all the options below work the same, they just vary in aggressiveness.  

1. Cobb: From what I hear, Cobb was awesome on the old N54 engines.  Unfortunately, there are no plans for the Cobb to ever be developed for the N55 on the new F30 and F10 models (due to the DME encryption).  

2. Dinan: Nice gains (more than the BMW PPK, but less than the JB4).  Comes with a matching factory warranty.  But it's crazy expensive (over $2k).  Paying for Dinan is pretty much paying for the name these days.  Bottom line, not worth it.  If the warranty is your main concern, stop modding your car or only go with the BMW performance options.

3.  Burger JB4: The most gains of any option and relatively affordable (~$550).  However, people have experienced problems with their DMEs being ruined after usage.  From what I was able to read the problems seem to be either water damage to the JB4 module or connections causing a short, a short due to not disconnecting the battery when installing/uninstalling, or just random bad luck.  When it works, apparently it's awesome though.  The unit is upgradeable too, so you can continually benefit from new maps as they are released.

4. Burger Stage 1: This is a more mild version of the JB4.  It only interfaces passively with 2 boost sensors in the engine (unlike the JB4 which hooks into the DME through the CAN wires and also taps into the car's 12v system).  This is extremely affordable ($379), very reliable, offers better gains than the BMW PPK.  It's not upgradeable, so what you get is it.  This is the unit I ended up purchasing and I'm very pleased with it.  Just be sure to weatherproof the module (I zip-tied a plastic bag around it and then wrapped it all in gorilla tape).

5. BMW PPK: This is the best option if you want to keep your warranty but want more power.  It is expensive (~$1.5k), but it's the software tune available.  The power increase should be a bit less than the Burger Stage 1, but BMW apparently loves to underrate HP #s.  Based on the reading I've done, it was called ""subtle, but better"".  You get a couple of ""cool"" other items with this too (""performance"" stickers for the side skirts, a new plastic engine cover, a slightly louder exhaust note, and your ""power"" gauge goes higher.  

6. Hartge: This is a German tuner that apparently sells a unit very similar to the JB4.  On the plus side, their unit is weather-proof.  On the downside, I think it's a bit more expensive and the company isn't in the USA so it's harder to work with if you're not in Europe.  I couldn't really find much about them on the forums either.

After all the research I did, I ended up going with the Burger Stage 1.  To me this offered the most gain with the least risk and the lowest cost.  The results aren't ridiculous, but it does offer a noticeable bump in power.  The tires are much more eager to spin now.  Overall, I just needed a little extra power to tie me over till I can finally get a M3.

7693,BMW,"To add another bit of perspective on this from someone who's already been around the tuning block, I had a 2007 335i with a JB4 tune, intake and exhaust that I ran from about 40,000 miles to 94,000 miles.  I just traded it in for a very lightly used M235i.

The JB4 definitely gave me the extra power it advertised and at a much lower cost than a Dinan tune would have.  It also came with its own set of issues and I believe running it definitely shortened the life-span of my 335i.  The main issues with the JB4 were consistency and driveability.  The reasons for this were not mechanical and were directly related to the way the JB4 works.

Basically, all the JB4 does, is trick the car's ECU into thinking it is delivering too little boost and causing the ECU to up that number.  It then relies on the engine's built-in knock sensor to adjust fuel trim as necessary to avoid premature detonation and other unwanted side-effects of this quick and dirty method of getting bigger boost.  The problem with this is that it leads to a lot of hiccups, occasional misfires and your car just sometimes not being responsive when you press the accelerator peddle.

This leads me to why I think Dinan gets away with being more expensive.  They actually correct for all the extra boost they run by doing more than just messing with the boost sensor.  Steve Dinan gives an in-depth look at what they do and why they justify their price here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYo0RvhLpzU

Quite frankly, in my opinion, they have a more elegant solution than Burger's JB4.  After my last go-around I'm not going to mod my M235i unless I can afford a Dinan tune or if someone like Cobb comes back into the market.  Just my 2 cents.

7694,BMW,"I have been driving my 09 E92 335i with the ZF auto for more than 6 years now.  ZF auto boxes on these cars (not the GM transmission on the 328i...) are pretty darn good if you leave it in the manual mode.  FYI, I track mine almost every months on the road course.  Even with significant engine (tune, DP, FMIC, fuel pump, radiator, oil coolers, etc.) and chassis mods (full M3 control arms, double adjustable coilovers, camber plates, LSD, bushings, etc.), I never found the transmission to be lacking.  What is better is that you can flash the firmware for the transmission to the same one used in Alpina B3, which has higher torque limit and faster/firmer shift.  Get a pair of DCT shift paddles from the M3 too, if you prefer the traditional shift pattern (left = down, right = up, not the silly push-pull on the stock pre-LCI paddles) like me.

For the premium that 335is demands, it is totally NOT worth it.  You might as well get a M3 at that price (but again, you should probably budget ~$3k for the rod bearing replacement on those S65 engines with more than 40k miles).",1.0

It's a non-issue, as long as you're not driving on bald tires at full speed, everywhere (RWD and snow tires have been proven to be better than AWD and all-seasons or summers by numerous publications and private tests). If there's going to be snow on the ground all year, every day, get snow tires, and you'll be fine. If they cancel work or the schools because it's not safe to drive, it's probably not save to drive. So don't. And if you live anywhere south of New Jersey, saying you can't get RWD because of the snow seems... silly.

My first car was an inherited Civic, and while I love the idea of recovering from a slide of any angle by pointing the wheels and flooring it, it's not a match for RWD as far as car control is concerned. Being able to really power out of a turn, or hold a controlled slide on a loose surface (rather than just being thrown around by the road), is a huge advantage even to everyday driving.

Regarding the M2 point, if that's in your budget (and it'll likely be quite a bit more expensive, because there's an enormous demand for that car), wait. But it'll be a long one, and you'll pay well over MSRP by the time you get the car.

I understand you need the Through Loading System in order for the rear seats to be folded down. Out of this list, I think Through Loading System will be a good option to have. 

I like the Alarm System too but wonder if it is a beneficial or a MUST. (I am coming from a 10 year old Honda)

Navi would be nice to have but given the new Idrive coming in 2014, not sure I want to pay for an older model. Plus, I dont drive much at the moment and dont intend for next few years.

It's sort of a swiss army knife of cars. It will do just about anything you want from a car with it.

However, it looks to be a decent example providing the fact you can overlook that its an 85 eta with diving board bumpers and older bumper surrounds. You can of course convert them to the 88+ plastic bumpers, but the rear takes a lot of work.

The car seems to be in decent shape, if the ad is entirely truthful a lot of the suspension work has already been completed. Diff swap is almost a necessity on the eta engine, which is a nice plus, but isn't an LSD :(. Dead si board aka dead speedo/odo is expected at this age, and isn't too difficult to fix.

Essentially it comes down to whether or not you can deal with a meh interior and paint job for a decent coupe... and if its worth it for that price. Around here I would jump on that, throw on an 885 head + i electronics, with the diff swap it'd be a fun ride, and a fairly cheap coupe at that. Drive it with the current suspension knowing full well soon enough it will need subframe/RTABs/etc like they all do at this age. ",1.0

&gt;__Södra länken__ (*The southern link*), __National road 75__ (*Riksväg 75*), is a [motorway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorway) in [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden) connecting [Essingeleden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essingeleden) ([E4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E4), [E20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E20)), [Stockholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm) with Värmdöleden (county road 222), [Nacka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacka). Södra länken is 6 km in length, of which 4.7 km is in tunnels. This makes it the second longest urban motorway tunnel in Europe after [Madrid M30 orbital motorway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopista_de_Circunvalaci%C3%B3n_M-30). The tunnel is 4 lanes wide each way at its widest point (total 8 lanes). The road has the designation [national road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_national_road) 75 (*Riksväg 75*).

&gt;The construction of Södra länken began in 1997, and was inaugurated on October 24, 2004. The total cost was about 7.9 billion [SEK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona) (around 800-900 million [USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Dollar) at the 2003-2004 exchange rate). The link was built primarily to decrease traffic in the centre of Stockholm. Given the high construction costs and the possibility that overall traffic volumes might increase, it was one of the greatest subjects of debate during the 1990s and early 2000s in the Swedish capital. It was financed mainly with governmental money and is not a toll road. The reason for building it in a tunnel almost all the way is a law from the 1990s which more or less forbids construction of a new motorway (or similar road) near residential areas inside cities, for noise and pollution reasons.

&gt;Södra länken is part of the planned [Stockholm ring road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_ring_road), with Södra länken being the southern section of it.

8137,BMW,"So depending on your symptoms, it can be one of two things. 

- best case scenario door lock actuators going/gone bad. It's not TOO expensive of a repair, but still probably slightly pricey depending on if you can find a good indy mechanic or not. 

- worse/worst case scenario, GM5 module is going bad. This controls things like door locks, but will generally give you inconsistent performance, like the remote opens some locks but not others, while the interior door lock button unlocks all of them... This module, if bad, needs to be replaced and is a bit pricey. 

But if your interior locking button both locks and unlocks the doors, it might be the GM5 module. When you click the remote, does it make a sound like it's trying to unlock?  Does the remote lock the doors?

It's been a while since I've looked at the details, but essentially you order a brand new BMW with the various options you want (I guess from your local dealer), tell them you want to do European delivery, and you get a slight discount on the car (something like 5% off msrp), airfare to Munich, a tour of the BMW Welt museum, and at the end of the tour they present your actual car to you along with two weeks of insurance and registration to drive around Europe in your own car. Then at the end of the two weeks you drop your car off at one of BMW's designated drop off points and they ship the car back home to you (although I think it takes something like 3 months for them to ship it).

pulling away from a parking space. The noise can be heard as a light metallic ticking from the front outer
cornering wheel.

CAUSE

Movement between the brake disc and wheel bearing hub.

CORRECTION

Remove and clean the front axle brake discs.
Sand the hub surface on the brake disc
to the wheel bearing hub using 80-grit
sandpaper.

Sand the surface in a radial motion
(inside to outside around the surface.
Clean the wheel bearing hub surface.

The SMG does have problems and most that have close to 100,000miles/160km range probably have had the tranny replaced. Lower miled ones I'd ask questions about personally. My e46m3 has a SMG with &lt;20k miles (78k on car) on it, it's clunking about just fine.

The slow iDrive system. 2008 was the LCI update which brought LED rear tails and facelift in general. As well, iDrive system was overhauled (new controller) which made it ""faster"" according to owners. There are a few other small differences between the years like door panel layout (or some form of interior IIRC), but not much else.

Everyone seems to have a ""Vanos issue"" whether it's a M or not. Personally, this shouldn't affect driveability but will incur some diesel trunk like rattles (which can be attributed to worn out bearings in the vanos gears) and loss of low end torque if it gets bad enough. Usually simply fixed by replacing the solenoids and o-rings. My s62 has 142k miles with no vanos replacement, all is well.

Once and for all, don't listen to the people who say do a bumper tuck or lower it. They're wrong. These cars are too nice and parts are too expensive (read: unavailable) to muck it up. Don't put Euro bumpers on it because they'll cost about what you paid for the car and still won't look right because your fenders are different. That being said, has it already been lowered or are the shocks frozen?

Second, if it hasn't already been done, remove all of the emissions equipment. The thermal reactors will melt your engine compartment and cause more overheating. They are easily bypassed. You'll have to find a 1979-81 528i for the right exhaust headers though if you want to fully disable the air pump system.

These cars are classy cruisers and great on twisty roads. They're not track cars. I know someone can show me evidence the contrary, but if you want a track car get a 2002 or 320i. You'll save in parts cost.

It was exact, colors, wheels, fully loaded, powered/heated vaders, HK sound, spoiler, cd changer, not lux package, full OBC, etc.  Looked to see where it was, couldn't understand why the listing didn't say where it was and it only said the town that I live in (not that big of a town).  I kepted looking and thought, why would it say my location on the listing?  Read it again... it was in my town!  I looked at the pictures closer and I could even tell where it was.  I drove over that night because I still couldn't believe it.  It was there.  The owner lived on the other side of the country and he left it at his parent's house.  Bought it a couple days later.

9116,BMW,"2009 was the first LCI (facelift) year for the E90. 

One common issue with the E90 line is the electric water pump failing around 90k+ miles. 

If it's an automatic transmission, have the transmission fluid and filter pan replaced as soon as possible if it was never serviced. Ideally this should be done around 50-60k miles according to ZF, the transmission manufacturer. 

How long it will last depends on your driving, driving conditions, and how well the car is maintained. 

Generally speaking, an E90 BMW paired with an N52 engine (325i, 328i, 330i) is a reliable combination. The N52 engine (naturally aspirated I6) is regarded by many as one of BMWs most reliable modern engines. 

2006-2008 E90s and anything that used an N52 engine during those years can have HVA tapping (hydralic valve adjuster). Oil pressure may not build in the head in time and can cause a tapping noise. This is most noticeable when the engine is cold. According to BMW, it won't cause damage, it's more of an annoyance. Only way to fix it is to change the engine head with the updated part. That being said, the LCI years have the updated engine head. 

E90 2006 and some early production 2007 models can have fading radio/AC/instrument cluster screens. This was generally considered resolved by mid 2007 production models.

Keep in mind, of course, that even aside from engineering your own solutions to these, you haven't run into any M54B30-related (this is your engine, since you have the 3.0) oil leaks, power steering leaks, or cooling system replacements. Not that those are preventative expenses, but what you're paying for is the drivetrain, and it does have to be maintained as such. I'm not trying to negate your fit and finish issues by bringing this up, but when I get into that mode with cars, it always helps to realize how much worse it could be.

Normally I have a tirade prepared on M62 timing chain issues in these cars (looking through my post history will confirm that—it's a $5000 head replacement if you neglect them), but that's insanely low mileage. Maintenance could become a headache as it ages depending on your level of patience (say hello to a world of power steering and oil leaks, as well as an eventual cooling system overhaul), but with that low mileage, you might be alright.

That said, don't expect the owner to budge too much on the price. $14k is too high, of course, but that won't stop people with these from letting them sit for sale for months with the same price. Try to bargain as much as you can, and draw from similar cars that have sold for much more reasonable prices, but just be prepared to have to fight that one out.

Also worth mentioning (quite importantly) is that when people say that $14k is M5 territory, they're comparing a 40k car to an M5 with 150k—and you should always, always get the trim level you can afford in the best possible condition. So in this case—as you seem to be doing—if the car checks out after a PPI, definitely get the well-kept 540 over a thrashed M5 that will be a nightmare to maintain.",1.0

I see a beige E60 M5 at the Hadley mall occasionally, but the black F10 M5 is often parked down in the lot across from the Smith indoor track, except it was parked behind town hall today. Funny, I sometimes car/people watch from the bench right in front of McLadden's, and I am fairly familiar with your 335i! Yeah, that's beautiful. I take pictures of most of the cars I see, so I just checked through my camera roll to refresh my memory. There's a blue Maserati Ghibli that parks just past Raymour &amp; Flanigan, in front of the Indian place, about every other week. Down by The Roost you can usually see an AMG or two on the weekends, and across from the police station there's a G55 (which is actually for sale). Recently, there's been a GTR in front of Mama Iguana's, and I've seen a Polestar Volvo around. Someone was driving around an i3 last fall, but I haven't seen it in a while, so I assume it was a loaner. There's also the orange Lotus that lives at the cement place near the NAC, and of course, all the Tesla's scattered around town.

Story of my car...

It was a cold and stormy October night, I was going to go check out a miata that is saw on cl, it was gonna be my first car. Mismatching tires, shitty eBay rims, destroyed diff, no carpet, no power steering g rain pouring into the car due to the lack of a rear window, I feel the paint... It is bedliner. I ask him to start it and I see flames pop through the hood. Weird I thought and realized the exhaust was going through the hood... $500 was what I got him down to. The bill of sale is made up and the title was given to me. I handed over the cash and the car was mine. 

For the past few months I've:

-installed longtube header

-put in stainless brake lines all around

-bought a used top and installed it

-bought a used vlsd (super cheap but will upgrade to torsen late this year)

-a bunch of other thing in attempt to make the car less douchey

Tomorrow I am finally registering my car and getting my license.

match the part number of the CD that you have with one from that list and see what it supports, If the part number matches with AUX, You are good to go. All you need is an AUX cable. if it doesn't, you waited $70 might as well put it back on eBay or smash it. up to you.

Then the new radio has 2 different things about it. 

* It no longer supplies power to antenna amp. pre 2002 /09 HU had a 3rd power cable running to the radio booster on driver side c pillar. Basically what the issue was in pre 2002 cars when you turn on the rear glass defroster the radio would just die. that's because there radio antenna is in the rear glass, and there would be interference issues with the radio amp power and the defroster. The post 2002 hu eliminate that issue buy redoing the antenna amp, and getting rid of that 3rd power cable from the back of your hu. If you still want the radio you have to replace that radio amp with a newer generation one, that matches the frequency of the one you have now. or your remote opening key wont work.(I believe there are 2 different frequency's)

* The new head unit started using a different antenna connector, can be easily solved with 2 adapters.

Both were very easy fixes. Honestly these cars are a dream to work on in my opinion. Most things are easily accessible (especially in comparison to any front wheel drive car) and they don't take a dozen different size fasteners for each item. I've done all work on mine except for alignments because I don't have the machine for it. This includes complete suspension overhauls and upgrades, a new clutch (original one lasted to 215,000 miles), valve cover gasket, VANOS seals, and all regular maintenance.

This last weekend I spent time on track and all I did was swap my street tires for race tires and I'm planning a brake fluid flash. Otherwise it took full-on race car like use as if it was a regular commute.

I can't comment on parts prices since I have no idea what they're like in Japan, but over here they're comparable with Lexus or Infiniti.

You absolutely do not need to keep the run flat tires. In fact getting rid of them is commonly recommended to improve ride quality and handling. You simply lose the mobility in case of a tire puncture. You can either put a spare in the trunk, carry a patch kit and compressor, plan on getting towed, or simply count on good luck that you don't get a flat tire.",1.0

9650,BMW,"I would go with that one as well, especially because it is higher quality polypropylene and not cheap plastic. That's a really good price for that bumper cover. 

Don't know how much you're willing to spend, but buying a new bumper cover and having it painted at a body shop is the cheapest way to go. The bumper cover on the 128i was kinda screwed up in a few places and it had license plate holes because I moved to a state that doesn't require a front license plate so I bought the M style bumper cover online for $400 (probably paid too much but it was the cheapest price I found for it) and had a body shop paint it for $200. Cheaper than a replacement from the dealer and looks better. I also decided to color match the grille surrounds since I had them off the car while replacing the bumper cover because the chrome ones look terrible.

[Here's the original bumper cover that was on the car](http://i.imgur.com/DTpY4It.jpg) (not the same car, but same bumper cover style)

[And here's the new one](http://i.imgur.com/d2fXnJo.jpg)

The only difference in the new bumper cover that I had to modify for was the headlamp washer holes. They are for the M aerodynamics retractable washers and the car had the fixed ones on it. I don't like the headlamp washers anyway and don't have a need for them in FL so I removed them and took the fuse out so they wouldn't spray and then used a plastic bonder to bond the covers to the bumper. That was my bad for not doing enough research and not knowing there were two different types of headlamp washer systems and ordering a bumper with holes for the wrong one. (I also forgot to have the body shop paint the headlamp washer covers so I had to do it myself. oops.)

As for a quick fix for your current bumper so you can keep driving it, is there any way you can zip tie it through the screw holes? I hate to suggest duct tape, but it may be your only option unless you want to apply some more epoxy which may be hard to clean up when putting a new bumper on. Are you missing the body nuts and screws to actually secure the bumper and that is why it was epoxied?",1.0
9651,BMW,"Okay, I just spec'd and ordered a 335i M-Sport through a popular online west coast BMW dealer. Here are a few recommendations:

* As others have said, NEVER put down money on a lease. BMW instead offers MSD's or Multiple Security Deposits. MSD's are equal to your monthly payment rounded up to the next $50, thus your MSD would be $265 -&gt; $300. You can put down a max of 7 MSD's which reduces your MF (essentially your APR) to .0008 from .0013. At the end of your lease, you'll receive your MSD's back (as long as you don't miss a payment) which makes it the best ROI you could have on that amount of money in 3 years.

* Know BMW leasing inside and out. What are the current BMW residuals, MF, and invoice on BMW's for the month of May? We're almost into June, thus they're about to change. Are there any additional incentives like Ultimate Drive Event or Drive for Team USA you could acquire?

* Shop around. Just because you think you have a great deal, send out feelers to your local BMW stores and potentially ones cross country. This is what I did and I'm taking possession of my BMW in Spartanburg,SC at the PDC for free in July (there is also a PDC in CA)!

* Plug your lease deal into a online Auto Lease Calculator. This will almost always show if your dealer is trying to hide any fees from you. Also ask for a complete cost breakdown line by line, including all drive off fees.

I just looked on realoem.com and you can buy the rear mufflers for a 335i individually as well as clamps to connect it to the rest of the exhaust. If it all comes as a single piece from the factory, cutting the old one off is definitely the required procedure.

&gt;

&gt;__Shooting-brake__ is a [car body style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_body_style) that has evolved through several distinct meanings over its history.

&gt;Shooting-brake originated as an early 19th century British term  for a vehicle used to carry shooting parties  with their equipment and [game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_(food\)). The term *brake*  was initially a chassis used to [break in horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_training) — and was subsequently used to describe a motorized vehicle.

&gt;The term was later applied to custom-built wagons by high-end coachbuilders and subsequently became synonymous with [station wagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_wagon) or estate.   *  *

It has 37/63 front rear split with up to 90% going to the axle that needs it. It has an LSD at the rear as well. Suffice to say that with snow tires it will not get stuck. The ABS is unique and very good on ice as well.

Reliability: Overbuilt (reliable with turbos and even an S54 swap from what I've seen) but needs some maintenance or it's a time bomb. Splines going into the transfer case need greased (they were barely from the factory) or they'll strip. It takes an hour and is good for quite a while so that's not a real drawback. Just have to maintain the front diff and transfer case because they're pricy.

The biggest problem with the iX is that northerners covet them as winter cars due to how excellent they are. As a result they are often rusty and still pricy.

The problem is that the car won't have the auto leveling and steering sensors necessary for the leveling and swiveling functions to work, if you score an OEM set.

I doubt it's a head gasket problem as the CL poster mentions either, as you'd almost certainly see smoke.

I'm guessing a failure in the fan clutch, thermostat, or something stupid easy like inadequate coolant or as OP suggests, a bad coolant line or hose in the engine bay.

In any case, the car can probably be fixed for under $300 if you can hold a wrench. Even if you bought it for $1500 and then paid a mechanic to fix it for you for a little extra, you'd still likely be getting a decent deal assuming everything else is good with it.

Long version:  All newer cars return exhaust gasses that escape beyond the piston rings (into the crank case) using some type of return to the intake (research EGR if you don't understand what I just said).  For most cars it's not a big deal because the fuel injection will clean off the intake ports on the head (upper side of the valves).  The N54 uses direct injection into the engine though, so this doesn't happen.  Hence, that oil-laden vapor gets carbonized on those ports pretty badly, leading to various issues.  The way to clean it is to remove the intake manifold, use a process that's kind of like sand blasting but uses walnut shells (to not damage the engine), and then put it back together.  The way to greatly reduce the frequency of needing this is to get an oil catch can ([like this one](http://www.burgertuning.com/BMW_335_oil_catch_can.html)).",1.0

A capable driver in an x3 would be able to reel in your focus just fine on most tracks. Probably not autocross, because that is a parking lot playtime event that rewards lighter weight. 

The x5m is not just a SUV. It is literally *as fast* as M **cars** around the ring. So not only does that kind of deflate your ""can't get past the weight and lift"" theory, but it annihilates it.

Furthermore, the X3 is not a SUV. It cannot function offroad. Period. It's a wagon with a slightly taller cabin. It handles like a wagon, just looks a little different. I assume the X4 is of the same vein. By the way.. an x3 weighs about the same as like a '15 Camaro. Not as heavy as you'd think. 

Now back to the topic on hand: Why do they offer vehicles like this for autocross?

Well, because if you weren't so caught up in image or some romanticized idea of you being the fastest guy around a track, you'd realize that the event is for fun.. and that driving an x4 in that setting could be REALLY fun. Of course, you don't want to try it because it is for ""moms"".

I'm not acting like the X3 is a sports car, by the way, if you'll see my flair - you can see that my sports car credentials are pretty much on point. I've driven them all, and I own 2 generations of M cars.. and yet here I am still telling you that the x3 is a finely engineered, composed, engaging driving experience that would put your focus (assuming non ST) to shame in almost every department... weird.

OP, I'm not sure if you picked up the REx version. If you did, it's worth noting that the 1.9 gallon fuel tank can physically hold 2.4 gallons. The fuel pump was coded to stop pumping at 1.9 gallons in the US purely because of regulations. In order to receive EV tax credits, the vehicle can't carry more MJ worth of fuel than the capacity of its onboard batteries. That just happened to be 1.9 gallons. Follow [this guide](http://tomasz.korwel.net/2015/01/16/favorite-i3-coding-change-9-l-2-4-us-gal-fuel-tank/) to unlock the extra capacity. There are also coding hacks that allow the REx to kick in sooner. In the US the REx is only allowed to kick in at 6% or so because of regulations. If you're going on a long trip it makes much more sense to have the REx kick in at 50%+ to giver the generator more time to build power.

10194,BMW,"I've been battling several issues with my 2001 530i (M54) for a few years. At its worst it would throw a system lean condition, misfire codes, and even shut off a cylinder or two making the engine really shaky (and very weak). The error codes I would get were very similar to yours: system lean condition alarms (this probably corresponds to your ""fuel trim bank 1/2 permissible range exceeded"" alarm) and misfire alarms on random cylinders. I've since replaced a bunch of stuff and now there are no codes and the engine runs really smooth. The engine isn't very responsive in my opinion so I'm still trying to look for things to fix.

I'd be interested in getting the actual P#### fault codes from the reader. For example, the ""fuel trim bank 1/2 permissible range exceeded"" doesn't tell us if the system detected an excessive rich or lean condition. That being said my guess is that your engine is running too lean.

In my opinion I do not think your issue lies with the ignition coils or spark plugs. The excessive lean/rich condition is most likely causing the misfires, so once the engine is able to achieve a proper fuel-air mixture your misfires should subside.

Here are the list of things that I did to finally fix my issue, listed in order of of how helpful it was to improve the performance of my car:

**Made a noticeable difference in improving lean situation + cylinder misfires**

* Fuel filter replacement (the improvement for this was HUGE)
* MAF sensor replacement
* CCV replacement (+ tubes)
* VANOS piston seals replacement (your engine is the same as mine so it is also affected by the infamous VANOS issue)

**Made a negligible difference in fixing lean situation**

* O2 sensors replacement (2x pre-cat and 2x post-cat)
* Fuel pump replacement
* Ignition coil replacements
* spark plug replacements
* fuel injector replacements

In hindsight some of the ""negligible"" replacements that I made could have been avoided... especially the coil and injector replacements- those parts are really expensive! Things like the spark plugs and o2 sensors I knew would wear out in time so didn't have many qualms replacing it earlier than normal.

But I did the replacements by myself over a couple of years since the codes themselves did not indicate a catastrophic failure of the car. (The yellow check engine light did bug the hell out of me though.) 

Here are some quick and cheap tests/procedures that you can try suggesting to the garage. It'll help you narrow down the suspect components and it'll keep the mechanics honest. Not sure if your warranty covers test of these kinds, but it'll be worth at least to ask.

* Fuel rail pressure test (too low of a pressure can be caused by a bad fuel pump or fuel filter and will definitely cause lean/misfire situations)
* Vaccum leak test (aka smoke test). Unmetered air entering the intake will cause a lean condition.
* MAF sensor cleaning. A bad/dirty MAF sensor can under-report the amount of air entering the cylinders and will result in too much air- aka a lean condition.
* and, as mentioned by others try asking the garage to move around the ignition coils around to see if the codes follow the coil. If not look into moving the plugs and similarly keep an eye out for moving codes. Word of caution though, when I was diagnosing my issue I found the misfire codes did indeed followed the ignition coils that I moved. However getting replacements didn't do anything to fix it. It's possible that the coil was marginal (but not actually enough to be considered faulty) and the misfires would *tend* to occur on those coils.

10371,BMW,"The 330i comes with a 3-stage intake manifold which uses DISA valves in order to direct/increase the flow of intake air into the cylinders that need it most. This optimization of air allows mid and top end power to be higher.

The 325i only has a single stage intake manifold and also has been detuned from the factory.

Also consider the 328i if it is available. It is just like a 325i, but with the ECU tuned from the factory to pretty much the highest output possible with the stock components.

All three cars, the 330i, 328i, and 325i utilize the N52 engine. Some 328is however may come with the N51 engine so make sure you check the VIN before purchasing.

Both the 325i and the 328i can get to 330i levels by swapping the intake manifold to a 3-stage one from any N52 engine that has it (330i, 530i, N51 328i/128i, Z4 3.0si, X3, etc.). This will also require you to reflash or tune your ECU so that the DISA valves are utilized, or else you will see no gains. If you are in the United States, Active Autowerke offers one for a decent price.

My suggestion is that you find a recent 328i (LCI facelift) that has an N52 engine and do the manifold swap later when you find a good cheap one from a used parts dealer/salvage yard.",3.0

Not everyone wants to drive a small car. Some people like big cars that can also go fast. The difference between myself and you is that I recognize there is a market for both a Focus and an X5M and I'm not going to criticize anyone's reasons for choosing them like you. I will, however, criticize people who want to act like their choice is the best choice.

And I don't even need to justify why it costs more. That is self explanatory. If you want to go around a track fast and don't have a lot of money and don't care about luxury features then buy the Focus. If you like luxury and comfort and pure, unbridled power and have a need for lots of space and you have lots of money, then the X5M will do all that better than anything other car I can conceive of. No one buys an X5M to drive it on a track. They buy it because they have a need for an SUV, can afford the luxury, and like the feeling of flooring a vehicle with shitloads of power.

Your second point is also correct, and I spoke too quickly about the B7. The F14 B6 does cap the 6-series range in luxury and (it is implied) prestige, however, something mentioned extensively at its official North American debut in New York at an entirely BMW NA-run launch celebration. But in the fact that BMW is importing the cars themselves, the claim that they are an entirely independent manufacturer is negated. Porsche does not import Ruf models into the United States; BMW, in comparison, sells the Alpina B6 through its dealer network and covers them under its sale policies, including a BMW warranty. And given that information, the company—at least in the US—is far more related to the manufacturer of the cars upon which its models are based than at any other point in its history (and for the vast portion of its history Alpina was, as we can agree, a completely separate tuning house like Hartge and, to a lesser extent, Dinan), and it has no reason to distance itself anytime soon.",1.0

The last Focus I drove was a brand new rental and the tranny failed on me during the week I had it. I did see Clarkson's review of it and he had some good things to say about it. I'm just not seeing it. My GF needed to replace her Honda Fit when her lease was up and I suggested she consider the Focus since I liked the first generation hatch, but after driving the newer ones I was disgusted with how terrible they were so I got her the 128i convertible instead.

It's still a partnership between two different car manufacturers. Yes, BMW NA and BMW Canada importing them to their respected markets and Alpina alone would've been able to do it. BMW imports Alpina cars without removing their own VIN and stamping Alpina VIN is what allows them to sell Alpinas in the US/Canada without any additional cost.

&gt;The F14 B6 does cap the 6-series range in luxury

F14 is a non-production development code, this simply does not exist. The only B6 that is imported to the US/Canadian markets is the F06.

&gt;Porsche does not import Ruf models into the United States

Ruf doesn't sell cars here either, just like Alpina for the first 30 years. However, it is more likely that we will not see Ruf cars here in Porsche dealerships. Porsche doesn't need to import a competitor. You have to realize that BMW imports Alpina cars that do not compete with their current line up. The only reason B6 is imported along with the M6 is that it gives them ability to gauge the US/Canadian market's interest in the xDrive performance cars. I bet once M cars will go xDrive importation of Alpina B6 will stop.

&gt;and for the vast portion of its history Alpina was, as we can agree, a completely separate tuning house like Hartge and, to a lesser extent, Dinan

I know europeans love hatches because their roads are so awfully small, so having something tall is somewhat useful, but their utility is completely lost in the american market. As long as the weight distribution is similar... and it would probably be better with the lower center of gravity and possibly wider stance, why would you care if that contradicts you narrowminded view of Type-R?

The Integra is the quintessential Type R, and it was based on a civic coupe frame. I'd probably prefer Honda bring back the integra/RSX, but I would still buy a similar civic  . The civic hatch is one of many honda type-r's so why would Honda possibly limit the civic type r to hatchbacks only, especially when expanding the distinction to a market that is as unfavorable to hatchbacks as the US.

As far as problems, we have had 0.  The computer on board will tell you when you need an oil change, new filters, etc.  If you follow those you won't have to many problems. 

The engines between the 3 vehicles we have had 04 EX, 07 LX, 07 SC.  There really isn't any difference in my opinion.

In regards to AWD, the onboard computer will automatically turn on/off the system depending on conditions.  You will not have control over any of it (unfortunately).

I would not buy this car if you think it's kid friendly, the suicide doors are a hassle.   I would go with the CR-V for conventional doors if you plan on having kids some day.

Since you are an outdoor person they are very good.  They are also good vehicles for dogs.  I recommend getting the EX for what you want to do.

My list of pros and cons as a daily commuter and as a college student.

Pros:
Very safe and easy to drive

Spaciously holds friends, and their gear.

Can be used as a light van, which is helpful more often than not

Beach trips are a breeze to clean up. Had a friend throw up in my 
passenger seat one time and clean up (although nasty) was a easy.

Super versatile car, with all of Honda reliability and has a beast turn radius.

Cons
Car is a bit slow with the K24. Anything over 80 feels a little sketchy

MPG isn't as good as it could be, I average around 20-24mpg hwy

Suicide doors can sometimes be awkward in certain parking situations, and people in the back seat cant get out unless theres someone in the front seat.

Its a very tall and broad car, so driving it in really windy, or stormy conditions gets very sketchy very fast, as the car will shift slightly when hit by a big gust of wind.

All in all though, its a great car, definitely one of Honda's most underestimated vehicles",2.0

442,Honda,"Hey there u/fassaction! Just saw this a few hours ago and thought i would weigh in. If you are 100% sure that it is the actual port itself then feel free to read on. 

A few things first, this requires removal of the radio and other dash components. The swap will take a few hours to do all the research and planning and probably 1 1/2 to 2 hours to complete. It took me about 30 is minutes to complete this morning, but i have taken the 8th civic dash apart a number of times.

Things you will need....

 * Phillips head screwdriver

 * 8mm socket and 1/4 drive ratchet. (may also need a short extension)

 * 10mm box wrench (to disconnect the battery)

 * Small flatbed screwdriver (for panel removal below radio) 

 * Radio code

**Disconnect your battery!**

The first step is to remove the radio, consisting of the drivers side dash panels around the tach and below the steering wheel. This will be the most time consuming step in the process and the most complicated.... feel free to take notes. Below is a video on how to take all the panels out, i would watch it a few times to grasp the teardown.

[Teardown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frWMCx1Y9tA)

Next you will need to locate the aux port this is right under the 12v port just below the radio. This will appear as a silver cylinder when looking down into the radio cavity. The aux port is located just below this.

[Some pictures that might help](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=55387591bdea126f!72663&amp;authkey=!AJX1lI3wtNaVtMM&amp;ithint=album%2c)

Onto the removal. You will need a long stick (your screwdriver might work for this) there are two squeeze tabs sides of the aux port you can alternate pressing each side while pulling and this should remove the port. After you have the port out disconnect the green plug from the back side and replace with the new port. Once connected press on the face of the new port and it should snap into place. Blue in your radio, hazards and airbag warning and reconnect your battery. turn the car to accessories enter your radio code and plug in the cable the radio should automatically switch to aux. If all is well turn off the car and reassemble the dash.

1) The take rate on the manual of the previous cars was LESS THAN 5%! That's a pretty crappy return on investment for them, given that this is a (relatively) low volume vehicle. For cars like the Accord and Civic, it's more viable to offer a manual because even with a low take rate, the volume sellers sell enough that they can make up the costs. 

2) Fuel economy politics. Yeah it sucks, but the 9AT gets better fuel economy than any 6MT would. And I don't want to row more than 6 gears manually even though I love MTs.

&gt;

&gt;The seventh generation of the [Honda Civic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Civic) was released in September 2000 as 2001 model. Compared to its [predecessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth-generation_Honda_Civic), it retained similar exterior dimensions, but increased significantly in interior space thus bumping up Civic to a [compact car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_car) size segment. There was a flat rear floor, giving better comfort to the rear seat passengers. This generation abandoned the front [double wishbone suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_wishbone_suspension), which had been used in the fourth to sixth generations, replacing it with [MacPherson strut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPherson_strut).

&gt;At its introduction in 2000, it won the [Car of the Year Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_of_the_Year_Japan) Award for a record fourth time, and it won the Japan [Automotive Researchers' and Journalists' Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJC_Car_of_the_Year) Car of the Year award in 2001.

&gt;A 115 hp (86 kW) engine powered all Civics (except EX and Si), up 9 hp (7 kW) from the previous model. Power in the EX remained at 127 hp (95 kW), and all non-Si engines were stroked to 1.7 liters for North America. Smaller engines continued to be available for the rest of the world.

731,Honda,"Mine is a slow project. In part because its old ('89 Hatch) and because I'm poor. Right now though, I'm in the process of bringing it back to stock. Finding all of the replacement oem parts, replacing some swap parts (integra seats, LS Mesh rims, etc) and general tune up. Once it's repainted, I'll start to focus on some more performance oriented stuff (engine/tranny swap, suspension upgrades, rear seat delete).

733,Honda,"I'm assuming your car is currently on either after market or chopped springs? Because otherwise you could've raised them. So, in this case you're left with really two options:      
1) buy stock replacements. This option is probably the best as far as lasting you a long time and being the best quality, however, longevity comes with a price, a particularly steep one depending on where you're looking. You could find a trade, but in that case you don't really know the condition.     
2) buy aftermarket. There are hundreds of options here, but as with anything, you generally get what you pay for. Those $200 coilovers are adjustable, but they're going to be crazy bouncy and will probably hurt more than they'll help. But those $700 ones? Maybe it'll be just what you need; close to stock spring rates, lowering/raising ability, etc.      
My opinion: go stock if you just want a regular height and ride that's going to last you, but go aftermarket if you want something a little tighter that you can adjust later (if that's your thing). In either case, it's always, always, ALWAYS better to save your money and invest than it is to just buy some eBay springs that will put you and your car in danger. Good luck.",2.0

Transmission was rebuilt, new clutch, new this - new that. It took almost 3 years for me to get where I am. 


How I got through it all? make a huge, HUGE excel spreadsheet of every single idea, part, cost, and where you got that cost. Having the numbers in front of you puts you into reality real quick about how serious you are about what you want. Also helps you track if you're getting a good deal or not. I won't mention what I spent, but I know I could have done other things with it but the ""honda thing"" is really what I'm passionate about.

Look for sales: black friday, tax return, end of winter, etc. etc. Search eBay, local ads, forums... I do this to save a couple of bucks but always beware that you are taking a risk if you buy used parts. Research is your best friend - everything else needs careful planning to work. Good luck!",2.0

it still does damage to the car. even parts that don't show ANY signs of it now, can turn into a headache down the line. sure they will fix it. but they are not going to give you a brand new frame if yours gets bent. they will bend it back, or total the car. once you bend that frame back it is now weaker and chances are still not as true or strong as an undamaged frame.

So a 1.8L Honda motor like in the Integra type R will not make less torque than a 1.8 in a corolla, but another car with a bigger motor or a turbo making the same hp as the Honda will make more torque.

1357,Honda,"I like the top two. I would be hesitant to purchase a car with swapped or modded internals, but since they mention having the receipt, it's probably been done professionally. Check out the receipts they claim to have, make sure they're legit. Be sure to look around in the engine bay for rounded off bolts, or anything else that looks janky. You should go check out the first two for sure. Prices seem pretty decent, and you can probably knock them both down at least a little bit. Look up the Kelley Blue Book estimated prices just to be sure you're at least in the ballpark. 

If you're mechanically inclined, I would recommend to perform a compression test on any engine you're considering purchasing. It's super easy to do, and can tell you much much more about the engine's heath than just a test drive will.

Be absolutely sure to ask about the timing belt. Figure out if it was done, when it was done (date and miles), who did it, and if they changed the water pump too. If it hasn't been done, you can estimate about $600-1000+ in additional expenses to replace it (much less if you do the work yourself). I'm guessing it was changed already on the swapped engine, but ask anyways, and definitely ask for the other vehicles.

If you can, see if the dealer will put the car on the lift for you to inspect underneath the car. If not, definitely bring a jack and jackstands, and crawl under and check the bottom and back of the engine block for leaks and residual oil. These engines are known for various oil leaks. If you find one, its not a dealbreaker (most are semi-easy to fix) but it will give you a good deal of leverage when it comes to negotiating sale price.

While you're under there, inspect suspension components for play. Check for torn rubber boots, and any play or looseness in the tie rods. Any issues here will probably be more expensive to fix than some of the possible oil leaks. Not a dealbreaker necessarily, but just another thing you can use to your advantage when trying to knock down the price.

1388,Honda,"A lot like a Fit sport, but less buzzy and more solid at higher speeds than the fit or insight. It can def hold it's own with the NA mini coopers imho, and most folks at the autox agree.

 Easily controlled oversteer at medium to high speeds, and less penalty for losing momentum out of corners due to the IMA (especially with the S+). Steering in sport mode is decent for what the car is; they did their best to give it some feel. Nothing close to the pre-electronic days but more solid than the insight or fit.

In a straight line...its pretty boring from 0-60. However you see it make up for that somewhat in the 1/4 time; it's also plenty quick at highway speeds because the IMA system makes sure you always have some torque on demand...S+ only makes this better as it lets you overload the IMA charge for 10sec at the push of a button.

1427,Honda,"This particular Prelude was owned by my best friend. It's the second Honda I ever drove and first Prelude I had ever been in. Ultimately, this car started my obsession with Honda and lead to my career choices working for a Honda dealer. 

The car itself has seen better days. My friend, who I consider my brother, bought this beauty in 2004 and had about 89k miles on it. She was basically bone stock. Now she boasts an impressive list of modifications, including a 5-lug conversion, Legend GS brakes, Tein SS coilovers, and an onslaught of JDM parts. There's too much to list. 

About 6 years ago the stock H23 overheated and cracked the head. A replacement head was fitted, but sooner after a tick turned into a knock and she was parked. He purchased his older brother's 92 Prelude with an H22A swap for a steal to swap into the 94. Eventually he decided to build a completely new H22A for the 94. 

Six years later and she's yet to move under her own power. She's moved from garage, to storage, to garage, slowly getting worked on, but never reaching a running state. 

I transported the vehicle from Arkansas to Kentucky past weekend. I have an assembled H22A, with Type S pistons, Bisimoto rods, Toga HV oil pump, manual tensioner, and balance shaft delete. The head is a stock H22A head. Transmission is a stock M2B4 (OEM JDM LSD). 

My plans are to get her running by the end of the summer. The drivetrain needs installed, new fuel lines need to be run, and wiring needs to be sorted out. I'll enjoy driving her for the remainder of the warm months, before she goes under the knife.  Most of the rubber components needed on this car are discontinued, so a lot of fabrication will have to happen. The interior needs reupholstered, the body needs repainted, but luckily no rust.

Its surprising how the whole car hunkers down when you press that Sport button, steering stiffens, throttle becomes a lot more responsive and it tightens up the suspension, but in the same way the ECO button does the opposite.  It retards the throttle and lightens the steering, forcing you to put your foot down to make the car work harder making your mind realise what you are doing more than you think.  And of course, theres a little plant growing game on the dash for you to play whilst being Mr Eco.

The ""big"" thing to keep in mind prior to timing chains (the 2010 Civic uses a chain..) was _never_ delay on the timing belt changes.  Ever.

Check around for general prices.  Kelley Blue Book (kbb.com) is OK, but those are just approximate price estimations.  Depending on where you live, the AutoTrader magazine ( http://www.autotrader.com/ ) will give you a good idea of the prices locally.

Things to check for:

1. Get the VIN and pull the car history. ( I know of CarFax, but there may be other options)

2. Look under the car at the frame, exhaust, skid plate and oil pan for damage.  Cars bottom out sometimes on bad driveways, so that is a fact of life.

3. Look for bad welds on the frame to ensure you are not getting a franken-car.

4. Check the brakes, tires, and calipers for excessive wear.

5. Look on the ground to see if there are any leaks (Greed or red is coolant, brown/black is oil, and smell-check any fluid on the ground to ensure its not mixed with gasoline.  Oil/gas mix is not good. Oil/coolent mix is also very bad.

6. Check the condition of the rubber in the engine compartment.  If it is dry or cracked, it could be aged, or the car sat for a while.  This is _not_ a golden-rule, but it will give you an approximation of what the engine gasket condition may be like.  There are many, many other factors that decide gasket condition, so like I said, its an approximation of the age of the rubber throughout the car.  Good places to check: Window seals, motor mounts, suspension bushings, etc, etc.

7. Look carefully at the paint.  Runs ( http://www.metalak.nl/images/lak23zakkers2.jpg ) are an indication that the car was repainted.  Cars are usually repainted after damage.  Paint runs from the factory are rare since paint is applied mechanically, and not by hand.

8. If it can move, move it.  Turn the wheel, open all compartments, press all the buttons, roll all the windows and open all the doors.  Open the door, stand on the frame, bounce, and check the suspension to ensure it is firm and not too ""squishy"" or bouncy.

9. Check the fluid levels and conditions. Black oil is bad.  Dirty transmission fluid is bad.  Low levels are bad.  Look at the level of the break fluid and check its condition if possible.

10.  Ensure that the detailers didn't Armor-All any leather. (This happened to me on a Benz that I owned once.  It was a nasty, nasty mess when I went to clean it again.)

11.  Feel the headlights for excessive pitting.  If there is a ""magic coating"" on there and it wasn't properly sanded and restored, you will feel it.

That should about cover most of the bases!  ;-)

Side notes, as you may or may not have experience purchasing cars:

Remember: The car price haggling with the salesman is mostly fluff and 99.9% B.S.  Believe NOTHING he says during that process.  If he starts drawing boxes, writing numbers with bizarre calculations, wants you to ""sign"" anything, IGNORE.  Find out the base price of the car or the max you want to pay, and do not deviate.  

The real ""scam"" is generally in the back-room finance process.  If you trust your bank, try and finance through them first if the deal is good.  Otherwise, use a finance calculator to try and understand what the total cost will be over 5 years.",2.0

Basically this. Honda knows that people aren't going to listen, so when the light comes on you should have around 2 gallons.  The estimated range is so wildly variable that you shouldn't count on it to be ""precise"".  The car doesn't know how or where you're going to drive for those last 2 gallons so there's no way it could know your range.  It also knows that ""people are stupid"" so there's still some gas (like half a gallon) in there when the range says ""0"".

If you're getting an older accord, *definitely* go with the stick. The auto transmissions back then were really clunky. Dunno if that's how all cars were in the early '90s, or just Hondas, but yeah. My 91 never felt like it ""knew"" what gear to be in and you kind of had to force it to shift by manipulating the gas pedal.

When I upgraded from the 91 auto to the 92 stick I felt like I was driving a sports car. Well, kind of. Lol.

But anyway, the auto trans in my 2005 Accord (my current ride) is fucking awesome. You don't even feel it shift and it's never awkwardly searching for the right gear. It gets amazing gas mileage and is super quiet. I'm often cruising around at &lt;2,000 RPMs, in both city AND highway conditions. 

I've never owned a V6 but I hear they're good, but maybe not quite as reliable as the good ol' Honda I4. 

TL;DR if you're getting an old beater Accord definitely opt for the stickshift. If you're getting a newer one, it's really up to your preference because the auto trans works great IMO.

Have you driven a CRZ? I've met a lot of people who hate them based on reviews...which is fair but I'm just curious. A handful of SCCA guys have lapped my CRZ and while nobody would be blown away, they were all surprised at how it drives because the numbers on paper aren't flattering.  Granted; I've modded the intake and header/test pipe, and mine sits lower on coilovers and 17x7.5's but the consensus is that the CRZ holds it's own and then some with the NA Mini's.  It only has 130hp, but about half it's torque is 100% available on demand from the IMA, so it doesn't lose speed in corners like most momentum cars do. It has a solid rear axle (like the 500 abarth :P) but it also has a 49/51 weight distribution.  That I can go the route of forced induction and still come out cheaper than an Si is noteworthy.  The HPD kit is costly for what it is though.

2078,Honda,"My GF went for the 2014 Fit sport and I used to drive a 2007 fit, so I can compare the two a little. They are both good cars with solid performance and reliability and handling for the price tag. 3rd gen has better speakers and looks, a little more HP and torque, and a better designed interior / controls. 

You should choose based on your budget. A lightly used 3rd gen fit is going to be expensive enough that I would just go ahead and buy new - aka it will be around 14-16k for a lightly used 2014 Fit, so I would just pay the additional 2k and get a new 2015. The fit is like civics and accords in that regard - the used car price tag is inflated slightly by the reputation the car has. 

If you go second gen, you're looking at perhaps 7-10k for a Fit with say, 50-75k miles on it. 

So if you're prepared to spend 20k, definitely just grab the 2015 Fit sport off the lot, you'll love it. If you're trying to spend 13-15k, grab a used 2013 or 2014. 7-10k -&gt; used 2nd gen in good condition with low miles.

2088,Honda,"The newer Pilots do have fluid filled bushings at the rear of the control arm.  When the split/crack they will leak fluid out.  

Your Accord does not.  Your Accord has regular rubber bushings at the front of the arm that do crack/tear over time.  Unless they are completely destroyed I think the issue you are having with the brakes is more likely related to the rotors and pads.  

You have two options with the bushings.  Either replace the bushings or the entire arm with the bushings.  You can easily replace the whole arm at home.  If you have access to a press you could easily change just the bushings at home as well.  If you know what you're doing obviously.  

Afterward you need to have an alignment.  

As for the brakes I would have the condition of the rotors checked and if they aren't grooved too deep or rusted too bad I would have them resurfaced and put new OEM Honda pads on there.  If the rotors cannot be cut, I would recommend OEM rotors as well.  If you are going to go parts store rotors I wouldn't get the cheapest ones you can find though.

Don't take my word for it though, check out reviews from Auto week or Car &amp; Driver for example and they all love the Accord Sport 6MT. [Accord Sport Review](http://www.http://m.caranddriver.com/reviews/2013-honda-accord-sport-sedan-long-term-test-wrap-up-review)

The V6 will obviously be faster in a straight line, but the i4 is no slouch and around town has plenty of pickup and go. Now if you do a lot of highway driving that's a different story...One added benefit of the i4 obviously, is the great gas mileage. It's fantastic in the city, but the gap closes with the V6 on highway. One thing to note about the V6 is that its a little more front heavy, so it's not as toss-able... Its definitely noticeable, but thats the trade off for more power.

Basically having a d16a6 bored out 25 over shouldn't be a big deal, several of my friends have bored out their D16's 40 over. For bone stock EFs, the main difference is the catalytic converter.  I bought mine online from magnaflow and purchased the CA version for my old oil burning EF and it passed like a champ. For the cam regrind and ECU, not sure how much of an smog effect it has. The real big deal would be your CAI and Headers funnily enough.

CAI and headers need a CARB approval sticker (California Air and Resources Board).  You can only get those through the manufacturer if they paid to get the product tested by CARB for approval in CA. (AEM, K&amp;N intakes for CA are typically CARB approved.  DC Sports Headers also have headers for the EF that are approved).  Smog inspectors in CA will seek those out those stickers if they see any bolt ons. 

I believe HKS is low key enough to get through smog emissions test (it looks stock enough). I have an HKS on mine and the smog inspector didn't really care about it. (may vary from person to person).

Engine: timing belt and tensioner (every 90k), water pump, gaskets, seals.

Tune up stuff: distributor cap, wires, plugs, ignition control module (you'll know its going bad if the tach is twitchy), coolant temp sensor (hard warm starts)

Transmission: fluid change, axle seals (if leaking), CV axles (if boots torn). If automatic, DO NOT MACHINE FLUSH. Do three tranny fluid changes with OEM Honda/Acura auto fluid, driving between each change. That's how the dealer does it, power flushing may cause problems. If you're manual and it grinds, consider running GM Syncromesh.

Front Suspension: inner/outer tie rods, rack boots, ball joints, wheel bearings, bushings, CV axles, brakes.

Rear suspension: wheel bearings, bushings

Jack the car up, grab the front wheel and give it a tug up/down, and left/right. Up/down = check wheel bearings. Left/right = check tie rods. Jack the car up, and stick a pry bar between the knuckle and lower control arm. If there is play, the ball joints are probably toast. Also visually check all the boots on said joints.

Get yourself a used copy of the dealer supplied Helms factory service manual, not one of those useless-by-comparison Chilton's or Haynes. The car is not difficult to repair on the road, and the Helms will tell you how to determine nearly everything. This sounds like a lot, but you can get most stuff from Rock Auto fairly inexpensively. A few parts I would get OEM, such as lower ball joints (I've had aftermarket break on me, scary), tie rod ends. Get from hondaautomotiveparts.org, way cheaper than your local dealer. Grab a Helms, and you can change nearly all of the stuff in your driveway, save the front wheel bearings (need a press, but easy), or the lower ball joints (though I've seen YouTube videos with people doing it).

You could also just buy the whole front pipe as you mentioned and do it yourself. While it does just bolt right up in theory, from my experience, exhaust bolts can be a major pain. Sometimes a combination of breaker bar and torch is required, and often the bolts will just break off (especially on a 20 year old car), in which case you'll need a cutting wheel, drill, and maybe a tap/die kit.

Probably your best bet if you just want to quit dicking around with it would be just to pull the trans and install a 'new' one. Since you'd have to pull it to replace anything inside, you might as well just have a fresh one waiting to bolt up. $500 seems about right for an imported one with warranty, but I'll bet you can find a cheaper one in a junkyard.

There have been automatics that are operated manually (manual valve body operation), automatically activated clutches on manuals, and many other interesting things throughout the years (Vacuum assist clutch! aw yiss)

Also have a centrifugal clutch for when stopped. Pretty neat.

There are some cars with sequential gear boxes (like a motorcycle) that have a clutch and just a rocker for a shifter... (Toyota MR2 spyder for example)

Over time you end up saving money just buying these inserts (I know the blades are very expensive). I don't exactly know the price but it may be around $18 for the front two inserts. To replace just the insert first remove the blade. Then look at the rubber piece and look to see which side to pull on. If you cant tell pull on one side until it slides out. There are 2 metal strips in the rubber. So swap those over to the new insert and reinstall it to the blade and then reinstall the blade.

Regular gearbox oil changes will defiantly help (honda recommend every  25,000 miles if the car is used in hot conditions or used for towing - im sticking to it anyway as its so easy to do). Its odd for calipers to need replacing...ive stipped and rebuilt calipers with fresh seals, but never replaced one. Some caliper servicing once a year would really help - pump out the piston until a clean shiny surface is showing, clean off all the shit and get it really cleaned up, then before squeezing the piston back in with some ter pump pliers, put on some red rubber grease (its vegetable matter based, and wont cause the seals to swell and fail like petroleum based grease does). Bushings definatly fail, especialy on an older car. Keep it rinsed down and really get in the wheel arches and underneath in winter to rinse off the road salt with cold water. If you can get it up on a ramp, you can apply something like ACF50 to parts to help prevent corrosion etc. a lot of these kinds of things ive learned from running motorcycles through winter. Keep on top of the oil changes and they run forever! Worth checking the valve clearences at your mileage just to check nothing has tightened up.

From what I understand, the F23A1 running a low boost, I should be able to get ~220HP without doing to too much damage long-term.  I will probably go to the junk yard this weekend to see if I can find a restore-able head that I can work with and study while this car is still a daily-driver.  I will most likely take this conversion in baby-steps, getting very familiar with the nuances of all of my own personal components.

Doing a full swap with an H22A, I would probably have to build the engine from the ground up.  In the short-term, it would cost me for the ""stock"" 200hp, but it would be a solid platform for future work.  IMHO, this would be the closest to a ""net-new"" build.  It will be good in the long term, but I understand it will take quite a while to understand, experience and overcome any challenges or nuances of this setup. 



Option 1, F23A1 Boost:

Pros:

1.  Time; Easy to get parts; Can buy ""spare"" components to rebuild while this car stays on the road.
2.  I am very familiar with this engine; There is a ton of information about what the limits are of this engine
3.  Little to no modification of the engine compartment, less the turbo setup

Cons:

1.  Anything over ~220hp is starting to sound silly.
2.  The cost for the moderate boost might negate doing a full swap.
3.  The engine will be ""maxed"", unless I do some serious re-engineering, which is beyond my skill atm.


Option 2, H22A swap:

Pros:

1. 200hp ""out of the box""
2. Just an H22A swap, without mods, is nice enough.
3. If I decide to mod further, I will have a strong base to work with.

Cons:

1.  Conversion kits are common, but it still means more conversion.  More changes generally equals more things that can go wrong.
2.  Cost.  Buying a newly refurb'd H22 will cost me.  Sourcing all the parts and building from the ground up will cost me.  Conversion will cost me.  
3.  Time.  I will not have the option to buy ""spares"" that I can swap out with my current engine.  I will basically be making a time investment in a new engine, which will take a ton of time to get right once I have it to the point where I can drop it in.

The reason HIDs aren't allowed in housings that aren't designed for them (either reflector *or* projector housings) is because the source of light in an HID bulb is often in a different position than the source of light in a halogen bulb of the same type.  This throws off the geometry of the reflections/projection and creates glare towards the eyes of other drivers and/or reduces the amount of light where you need it.

Note that the type of housing (reflector or projector) has nothing to do with whether it works with HID bulbs or halogen bulbs.  This is a common misconception.  Many people think that all projectors must have HID bulbs, or that HID bulbs only work in projectors.  The only thing that matters is the geometry of the housing with respect to whatever type of bulb it was designed around.

Anyway, there's no guarantee that putting an HID bulb in a halogen housing will produce glare.  It could be perfectly usable.  The best way to find out would be to put an HID bulb in one side and keep the halogen in the other, then drive up to a wall and study the light pattern.  Any light above the obvious ""cutoff"" pattern is glare that will bother other drivers.  It's very unlikely that an HID bulb in a halogen housing will produce no glare, but possible.

If you must buy HID bulbs to put in your halogen housing, then aim your headlights down significantly.  This is what I did for years.  I had installed HIDs willy nilly and was getting flashed all of the time.  Then I aimed them down and was never flashed again.  They still illuminated the area in front of me well enough because HIDs are significantly brighter than halogens.

The safest bet would be to retrofit.  But that's a lot of time and work (or expense) that most people don't have.

My recommendation is to buy a specific kind of HID kit and a specific kind of aftermarket housing, because this worked well for me....

The HID kit is made by Kensun.  They can be found on Amazon.  They are very cheap, but the build quality is solid, and I've gone 2 years with them without even the slightest hiccup.  (I've had lots of problems with my previous Xenon Depot kit.)  Most importantly, the chamber in the HID bulb where the arc sits (the source of light in an HID) is positioned at the exact same spot as the filament in a halogen bulb of the same type (at least, with the bulb type that my car takes).  In other words, the light from the HID bulb should be thrown at all the same angles as the halogen bulb, and therefore produce a clean cutoff with no glare or lost light.

For the housing, I would suggest Depo.  They may or may not make headlights for your model/year - I don't know.  But I bought their aftermarket projector housings for my car, and, with the HID bulbs mentioned above, the cutoff is absolutely *perfect*.  It's like my car came with HID projectors and/or I spent tons of money/time retrofitting them.  But instead I spent, like, $200 total and bolted on some parts.  Anyway, with a cutoff so perfect, I can't help but conclude that Depo pays attention to this stuff and ensures that their headlights are functional as well as pretty (although I understand the latter is subjective).

As a final note, do *not* get a color temperature above 6K.  Anything above 6K will be blue.  No, not a ""*hint*"" of blue - just fucking blue.  That's distracting to other drivers and, worse, gives you less usable light to see at night with (because it's blue, not white, duh).  It's also stupid, and screams, ""LOOK AT ME I'M 16 AND I HAVE COOL LIGHTS LOOK LOOK LOOK AT ME!!1""

EDIT: Haha, I see now that you already linked to Kensun.  Nice.  I would recommend the 5000K kit, but if you must have your ""hint"" of blue, 6000K is fine.

EDIT2: To clarify, ""retrofit"" means to take a projector housing from another car or set of headlights -- one meant for HID bulbs -- and install it in your own headlight housing by gluing/bolting it in.  This involves taking your headlights apart, fabricating parts (shrouds), figuring out how to aim/level them, etc.  A lot of work.  Just throwing an HID kit into a housing designed for halogens is not ""retrofitting"".",3.0

What you can also do is do retrofit projectors on the headlights it's a simple install and makes the lighting a lot better. 

We have standard HID kits with life time warranty for $30 and better kits for other prices and we have really good projectors starting a like $50 for the set so they're not expensive at all.

There is a difference between tasteful modding, and themed modding. Yours unfortunately hits neither target in my opinion.

A suggestion for a green and black theme.  Keep the car black, get rid of the green Homda badge(s), gas door and fog lights.  The green toe hook, and license plat bolts can stay and either make the lip of the rim green, the entire rim green or keep it black and have green lug nuts.

3409,Honda,"This sol has potential. There are things that work for it and others that definitely don't. I would paint the gas door to match the flat black or even paint most of it black and outline the edge in green accent. The all green gas door makes it look out of place. Get some better fitted wheels (black wheels with green accents) and tires, even the brake calipers could be green. Ditch the fender flairs. The rear could use a green (small) spoiler. I would reverse your paint scheme for the interior, i.e mostly black with green accents etc. Do some work for handling, sway bars and strut tower bar, lower it a little with spring/shock combo or coil overs. Lastly I would focus on engine work make it reliable yet provide decent power, take the head to a machine shop and have them port and polish, toss an aftermarket cam in it and an exhaust system with resonators to kill the ricey sound. This could easily become a sweet del sol with some needed adjustments.  ",1.0

With that said, I've never bought a car that wasn't on the lot, but my step-brother has (a BMW) that he ordered, you should've got an itemized list of all the accessories and VIN of the car you ordered when you signed the papers to buy it.  If the car didn't have these accessories, or had more, or something was wrong, then they fucked up and should fix it.  Of course, with that said, if a car dealership is particularly soulless, they know damn well that you're not going to take the to court because it's not worth it, the cost of a lawyer would far exceed the cost of being ripped off the on accessories.  Scummy car dealers know it's not worth you fighting for it, so ultimately you won't do anything.  

I think your only recourse is to call Honda corporate, I've had to call corporate BMW to get things moving when my local dealership tried to chingale (fuck) me.  

To play a slight devil's advocate for the dealership, every Fit accessory is dealer installed, the car comes from the factory in the basic trim levels, the dealer does the rest.  The Fit wasn't really made to be like a ""made to order"" car with a bunch of a different factory mix and match accessories and trim levels like say, a BMW 4-series.  

The dealership of course, knows this when they sell the car, but had to a find a white Fit for you.  So more than likely sold you the car that was on another Honda dealership's lot already, not knowing it already had a pinstripe (again, Fits hit all dealerships with no accessories at all, the pinstripe was probably dealer installed at the other dealership, so they couldn't have known it was there), and didn't think it would be big deal.  As for the other accessories, I couldn't quiet understand what happened there thanks to your poor grammar (sorry, I understand you rage posting).  

I do have a question, Houston has something like 8 Honda dealerships, why did you walk into this one and order one when I'm almost certain you could've found the car you wanted sitting on a lot already within an hour's drive, and then ordered the accessories when you got there?  ",2.0

3519,Honda,"Oh boy, long list of stuff, but I'll do my best based on my knowledge and personal experience. First, as far as reliability and customization, the 90's Hondas and Acuras are your best best. They're a dime a dozen, they will run forever with regular maintenance and there are more parts than just about any other make/model.     
As far as auto vs manual, considering that you're commuting fairly consistently, I would definitely go with automatic, especially if you don't have the experience driving a stick. The only real differences are that manual saves (a negligible) amount of gas mileage and feels sportier. For a daily commuter, an automatic is simpler.     
The 80's vehicles are great and simple, but they're getting harder and harder to find and as such, any necessary repairs are going to cost you. In my opinion I would look into EG/EK Civics (92-00). These cars are everywhere and you can find a quality one well under $5k.      
Additionally, with a couple hundred bucks you can make them look great, and for a few more Benjamin's  you can have a little more power for your beater.     
Car stereos with the new basics (USB/aux/etc) can be found for around $100 and install depends on whether you can do it yourself or if you go to a shop (and of course can change depending on the company).      
Security and alarm systems are varied, I would contact your local shops and get quotes from all of them. We got a security/locks/trunk setup in my mothers car for $500, so shop around and figure out what you need.

In my opinion I wouldn't even think about buying an automatic. In these year ranges I swear this is the only thing Honda couldn't get ~~right~~ perfect. The D, and B series, transmissions are very forgiving, and damn near bullet proof. Take care of what you have, and keep the maintenance up to date and you won't have a problem.  
  
Cars I would suggest vary really, only because the cars from these years are all my favorite, so I could be biased. 92-00 Sedan is a pretty nice family car, with plenty of room for improvement, whether that be aesthetic, or performance minded. The first generation(1997-2001) CR-V can also be had for the price range you are shooting for, which would be a great daily driver.

",1.0
3568,Honda,"Could be, just depends. For most things, especially performance parts, I always suggest quality over cost, because in the driving/racing world you often get what you pay for. You may buy a coilover (suspension lowering) system for cheap on eBay, but it will likely blow out and leave you stranded within a few months. Or, you can save and invest in a quality set that gives you both aesthetic and performance that you want along with longevity. Forums will be your best bet in finding out which companies and parts work best for your car.      
Generally speaking, the sportier cars will be manual transmission, but there are other things to bring into the equation like weight, handling, etc. In regards to Honda/Acura, your Si/GSR/type-? Are going to be the sport/performance edition of any given car. You can google the models to see the differences in weight, horsepower, suspension, etc. but if it's performance you're going for, it may be worth it to find a manual transmission in good condition and learn. It's not too hard and can be very rewarding after you get it down. Plus, seeing as you're in Miami, you won't have the challenge of learning to drive up and down steep hills.     ",1.0

&gt;The sixth-generation [Honda Civic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Civic) was introduced in 1995. It retained its class-leading handling, [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] thanks in part to its front [double wishbone suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_wishbone_suspension). However, the sixth iteration of Civic did not have the high [power-to-weight ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio) of its predecessors. Two wagons were also made on the platform; the JDM [Orthia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Orthia), based on the Civic sedan, and a [Domani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Domani)-based model, sold as Civic Aerodeck, in Europe. Neither were offered in North America. A Domani based five-door liftback was also offered for sale in Europe alongside the regular Civic model from 1995 to 2001.

3687,Honda,"IMHO, swapping to a B series might be in the same arena as moving to an H series.  New engine, new problems.

I guess it boils down to the learning-curve.  Basically, I need to learn the basics.

There is a cheap head I can get this weekend for my F23, and will have time to tear it down and clean it up.  The plan is to learn the inspection process, as I have the tools to ensure factory tolerances on it.  From there, I'll start taking things up a notch.

New valves/springs will probably be first.  But still, I have to find a good local machine shop that I can trust to do the grinding for me... That will be a few days work in-itself.

The trade-off is, that I won't have a running engine to test my baby-step-mod-approach if I go with a full engine swap.  I simply wouldn't have a way to test each modification as I make them.  Real-life or on the dyno.

&gt;

&gt;__Motor oil__, __engine oil__, or __engine lubricant__ is any of various well-developed lubricants (comprising [oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil) enhanced with additives, for example, in many cases, [extreme pressure additives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_pressure_additive)) that are used for [lubrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubrication) of [internal combustion engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine). The main function of these lubricants is to reduce [wear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear) on [moving parts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_parts); they also clean, inhibit [corrosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion), improve sealing, and [cool the engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_cooling) by carrying [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) away from moving parts. 

&gt;Motor oils are derived from [petroleum-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum) and non-petroleum-synthesized chemical compounds. Motor oils today are mainly blended by using base oils composed of [hydrocarbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon), polyalphaolefins (PAO), and polyinternal olefins  (PIO), thus [organic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound) consisting entirely of [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon) and [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen). The base oils of some high-performance motor oils however contain up to 20% by weight of [esters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester).

Edit:  The SAE designation for multi-grade oils includes two viscosity grades; for example, 10W-30 designates a common multi-grade oil. The first number '10W' is the viscosity of the oil at cold temperature and the second number is the viscosity at 100 °C (212 °F).

3760,Honda,"Bad example, but I hope you were trying to see my point and not just latching onto the fact that I don't know some minutae about what filters fit on what.

It's clear my overall point is being ignored because... I don't really know why. 90% of the EM is the same as the EJ. Without the engine, you've got a 99 Civic coupe that's the same as any other 99 Civic coupe, except it came from the factory with rear discs and a big sway bar. The Si distinction at that point is basically meaningless, because what you're left with isn't much different than any other Civic coupe of the same era.

Think of it like this: If I take a 94 Civic VX and rip out the VTEC E engine, that's not really a VX anymore. The whole point of that car was the engine that gets 50+ MPG. If you put a B18 or K20 or whatever into it, it's now an EG hatch that came from the factory as a VX, but it's got none of the parts that made it a VX left.

Its the same featherweight build philosophy with an emphasis on handling over power though, but an even lower min weight and no turbo pounds on the nose.

Make sure you can adjust the seat and steering wheel into a comfortable driving position. It's a great car with lots of room, but you don't want to buy it only to realize it's not quite a good fit for you.

2. If you can afford the EX, just get that. Utterly no reason to save money with the LX unless you want aftermarket rims anyway/hate the infotainment console/hate moon roofs. I got the LX just because that was all I could afford and while it's well-equipped, the EX is obviously more fun and luxe feeling. Check out the fitfreak forums-- there's a post of how much people have paid for their cars and their location. Could be of use in negotiating. 

3. It's an awesome little car. Some people might tell you to stay away from the 2015 due to the new plant in Mexico and all new design, but at this point in the production, you're not likely to run into any issues in fit or finish.

4143,Honda,"Type SH has the M2U4 ATTS equipped transmission which is designed to increase cornering ability and decrease understeer. It only comes in manual. I have heard nothing but good things for the system. The Sh also comes with things like beefier suspension all around, courtesy lights in the doors, stock Enkei wheels, slightly more aggressive cams to combat the slightly parasitic nature of the ATTS, rear spoiler, painted side skirts, and a few other things I am forgetting right now. The forums have many posts listing all the differences. Is it reliable? Um...have you heard of the Prelude Curse? Your mileage may vary but in my case, the Prelude curse is very much a real think. My BB6 has cost me sooooo much money even with me doing all of the work on it. Is it fast? For a stock Honda? Yes. Compared to many other sporty cars? No. It is still faster than most cars you encounter through your day. Does it look nice? That's an opinion. I hated the way they looked when I bought mine but I am beginning to like it. The interior is fantastic for the driver though. Everything is clearly laid out. The gauge cluster is superb. Can it last for 200K? Yes, but expect oil leaks. The H22 is known for them. Mine is currently at 170K. It runs strong with high compression but eats coolant and makes some funny noises here and there. The aftermarket is pretty good although parts are very expensive compared to Civics but that's because it is a lower volume car. I would highly suggest driving the car. I can honestly say that is the only reason I own my BB6. It is soooo fun to drive. It is on the large side, and the interior is cramped, every passenger will be uncomfortable, but you will put up with it because gunning a corner at 5000 rpm and coming out of it as vtec cracks is just amazing. For the record, I have grown up with BB6's. My dad has owned a 2001 Type SH since it was minty fresh and now I own a 1998 Type SH in an odd twist of fate. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY AN AUTOMATIC BB6.
EDIT: For reference, my BB6 has been beaten on it's entire life. It's currently on at least it's second transmission and third set of struts. The previous owner had no mercy I guess. All I can say about my dad's car is that I don't think he knows what vtec even is. I'm sure he's never revved it out high enough to find out. Both cars spend a good amount of time being repaired, much more than my brother's EJ, my mom's EH2, and my other brother's GD3 but again, your mileage may vary. I just want to give you my experiences. This sub has a couple of BB6 owners so I hope they chine in with their experiences. If you work on the car yourself, it is pretty easy. There's a good amount of space in the bay for getting stuff done. The hood is long so if you are short like me, things like valve adjustments are a little tough. Much easier to work on than any German or American car I've worked on. ",1.0
4144,Honda,"That was a great read. I'm feeling like the general vibe is that the SH is a pretty sweet car, but have to watch the oil. Otherwise it's solid enough for someone like myself, that needs a cheap cool car.",1.0
4145,Honda,"&gt;Is it reliable

yes and no. the manuals are, the automatics aren't.

&gt;is it fast

eh....if you've never been in a car that is actually fast, then yes. 

&gt;does it look/feel nice

IMHO, its one of the best looking cars Honda has created. but, the 5th gen is definitely not loved by all. Preludes are already kind of the red headed step children of Honda, and the 5th gen probably had the most polarized opinions about it of all the preludes.

they drive and feel great. very responsive. the interiors are starting to look dated though...i realized that when i got my accord. also, they don't really U-turn very well.  

&gt;can it last for 200,00 miles or not

your god damn right it can.

&gt;how's the aftermarket mods on this model

well, its a 16 year old car. so keep that in mind. some parts are getting tough to find. that being said, there is still plenty out there, all the basic bolt on stuff. and really that's all you need. the H22's don't really lend themselves to high power output due to the inherent design on the motor...but the basic bolt-ons will give you a little more responsiveness that you'll love.

&gt;And what's the difference between SH and base

the SH has ATTS, with is Automatic Torque Transfer System. basically, its a limited slip differential. also they came with a few other options- different wheels, slightly different trim inside, stuff like that. honestly, most people prefer the base model.


&gt; just any overall comments for this vehicle

if its an automatic, don't bother getting it. because you will have to replace the transmission, no matter what, and that's not cheap. Always have like 2 quarts of oil in your car with you, the H22 burns up oil...the more your in vtec, the more it burns. also, keep a close eye on your oil! these cars sound awesome with just an intake, so start with that...you will probably love how it sounds. and, standard advice around here, get the timing belt changed.


that's all i can think of for now...",2.0

4171,Honda,"&gt; You can't out engineer Honda son.

As any engineer, will tell you, it depends. 

Honda engineers (or any large engineering project engineer) have a huge number of requirements levied on them to deliver.

Schedule, weight, cost, safety, reliability, form-factor, NVH, fuel consumption, etc.

They could make the car faster if they dropped the carpets and sound deadening in the cabin, and opening up the exhaust. To the detriment of actually being able to have a conversation with a passenger. 

They could make it handle tighter, but the car would rattle your skull if you drove over anything other than glass smooth roads. 

They could make cars with far more naturally aspirated power. But the engine might not last in excess of 100k miles, or be reliable to start up every day, and add a few thousand dollars to the price for higher spec parts and complete hand assembly. 

Engineering for mass markets is a giant trade study. Hitting all of these targets reasonably well is why Honda/Toyota/etc are respected. But they have to work inside an envelope. There's something to be said for a car that's fun, and turns on 99.95% of the time. (made up percentage that says your car will fire every day of the week, every time for slightly more than 5 years.)

Hondas are known for being soldiers. Take it one step at a time, from the most critical to the least. Tires should be done first. I just spent the money on new tires because not only can you hurt yourself but also others on the road. 

That's a cost that obviously you have to pay someone to do but believe me, it's worth it. 

Aside from that, the little things aren't really a big deal to fix, there hundreds of tutorials online and various forums like HT, Nwp, ek9.org, civic forums, etc etc. besides salvage yards are packed with Hondas, so finding parts will not be a problem.

If it ain't broke, why fix it? Right? Assuming it runs strong as you stated. Regular maintance should keep your car that way, if you plan to get a new car down the road, having a running car NOW, buys you more time to save up!

Secondly, purchasing *any* used car has no bearing on ""supporting the ____ workers"" no matter what country's name is in that blank. They were supported when the car was bought new. The only person you're supporting buying that used car is the current owner.

So, really the only people you can help now are:  
**The parts employees** (whether dealer or aftermarket; almost all American unless you're buying direct from another country)  
**The parts distributors** (again, mostly American. Honda parts will come from one of about a dozen different warehouses in the US).  
**The parts *manufacturer* employees** (almost all non-American).

I was going to replace it myself but the old exhaust bolts were too rusted and had a shop do it for me for $50. So total I had $350 invested. Not sure how much a new cat will cost you since yours is hybrid (not sure if there's any difference from a normal cat) but $1500 seems kinda high. Check on Amazon or magnaflow's site.

It's just getting the actual mirror unit to stay in the base it swivels off of that's a problem...it fits in there but won't stay attached, so I guess maybe something is also broken internally that I didn't see at first. 

I decided to just spring for the new mirror since it's actually painted to match my car and apparently a decent price for that.

4937,Honda,"I got lucky and picked up the EX with all the bells and whistles except apparently there was an option for a built in GPS that the 1st owner didn't buy it new with. It has heated black leather seats, mine have minor cracks because the first owner didn't take care of the leather, but I do now and it hasn't degraded any more since I bought it over 5 years ago. Nice quality, super nice to have the heating option and a black interior in colder climates. 

It's got the same road noise that any Hondas have, we've had older model Civics and older model Accords and they all hum and have some road noise, none are as quiet as some of the nicer model Acuras, but no rattling of anything in the interior. I have never had a jetta so I can't compare interior noise unfortunately. Plastic parts aren't junky though and haven't loosened as far as I can tell. I once had a '95 ford mustang (it was a long time ago, don't judge me) and the plastic door panel literally fell off on me, so I know junk plastic in an interior when I see it.

I can tell you that the '03 accord ex coup with the manual 6 speed has an Acura transmission apparently. Learned that after I bought it. Awesome pick up if you're trying to get up to speed quickly (everybody I've allowed loves driving it) we used to jokingly call it the ""secret sports car"" because it's faster than it looks like it would be, lol. 

Lots of weird but convent little extras like being able to roll up or down the windows from outside the car by putting the key in the door and turning and holding it in that direction (Convenient for living it hotter climates.) Traction control system stops a wheel from spinning if you start to slide in bad weather, works great and you can just shut it off if you don't like it. I'm trying to think of any other downsides, but really the not being able to take turns at 80 mph in quite the way the '02 can because of the more ""sedan like"" body style is really it. But it's heavier overall than the earlier body style so the ride is definitely smoother but you will give up good mpg by just getting the V6 over a 4 anyway so at that point who cares. ",2.0

It's a huge difference in visibility because during the first night I had them installed, I saw many small potholes that I didn't even know existed around my neighborhood. For installation, I decided to take off the car bumper to mount the HID ballasts, but it was still an easy installation process - everything else is literally plug and play.

Color temperature may slightly vary depending on the kit's manufacturer, but mine are rated at 6000K (they're closer to 5500k imo). I've driven behind a few of my friends (SUVs, sedans, sports cars) and the general consensus is that the HIDs are bright, but not blinding - even the FR-S driver didn't have any complaints.

I had only practiced maybe 30-45 minutes total in a friends '04 RSX-S. That car wasn't too hard to get going, but he wasn't the best teacher either. My father and another more patient friend corrected and helped me immensely.

The first two days were *rough*. A lot of stalling. Getting going from a stop was frustrating as all hell, but I went to a parking lot late late at night by myself and tried to learn the clutch (very springy). By last Sunday I really got a feel for it and how to simultaneously let up on it while giving the right amount of gas.

Absolutely love the car. I appreciate everyone's feedback from that 16 day old post. And thanks for the stickers /r/electricmarauder! Brings back memories of their early 90's Civic ('91 I believe). My father had a good laugh when he saw those.

Make friends with someone with a truck :)  Or, if you REALLY need the extra space, do what another poster suggested and buy something cheap to DD, like an older Accord or CR-V.

Super easy to daily drive.  The seats are some of the most comfortable I've ever been in.  (There's a reason they are stolen lots.)  Clutch is easy, no harder than any other Honda.  They hold up just as well, too.

Maintenance isn't bad at all.  Regular fluid changes.  Common wear items are the timing chain tensioner and clutch slave cylinder.  I put 25K+ trouble-free miles on mine.  I did have to replace the TCT though, around 70K miles.  Super easy job, the part is around $150.  

Not related to your questions, but one other thing I will say is that the paint on S2Ks isn't great.  Since you live in LA it might not be an issue, but it's very common for rust to develop on the rocker panels and around the wheel wells.  Keep an eye out for that if you're buying one.

Oh, one last thing.  Not sure how much you drive, but high mileage REALLY brings the value of these cars down.  It's a very niche market vehicle.  If you want to DD one, I'd say make sure it's a car you're prepared to drive for a long time. ",2.0

5291,Honda,"First of all, 17k is a pretty decent amount of money, considering that the a new civic's MSRP is only slightly over 18k. If you could possibly stretch you budget a bit you could have a new vehicle. If I recall correctly, mine was just under 20k out the door. Next you need to let us know what your priorities are. Are you looking for a vehicle to mod? Is gas mileage important? Cargo space? Transmission? Sporty-ness? Speed?

If 17k is your absolute max then I almost any used civic with good maintenance will be fine. I can only speak for the 9th generation as it is the ones I am most familiar with:

The 2012's will obviously be cheaper since they are older, the downsides being that the interior looks slightly worse than the 2013s, [as the radio and air conditioning controls are made out of cheaper looking plastics.](http://media.caranddriver.com/images/11q2/405839/2012-honda-civic-ex-sedan-interior-photo-408407-s-1280x782.jpg) Also the sound deadening isn't as good as the 2013's, so road noise will be a bit higher. 

The 2013's have an [improved interior,](http://carsmag.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2013-Honda-Civic-LX-Interior.jpg) and looks much cleaner in my own opinion (which is biased of course considering that I own one). Sound deadening is improved so road noise is reduced. Another small feature that has been added is a retractable center console/arm rest, which allows you to slide it forward a bit. The front and rear fascias of the 2013 sedans have also been changed quite a bit. Technology-wise, the 2013s come standard with a backup camera, as well as bluetooth connectivity, which were only available in some trims of the 2012s. Lastly, from what I have heard, the 2013s do have improved safety features (source needed).

I am not too familiar with the 2014s/2015s, but I do know they have a few changes. The front and rear fascias of the coupe have been changed significantly, the standard rims are different as well. They offer smart key entry, lane watch, as well as push button start, depending on the trim. The biggest change is that they now all have the CVT transmission with a manual transmission still being offered in some of the trims.

As for the 8th generation (2006-2011), I do not have much experience with them, but they do share a very similar engines (Honda's R18), so it should have the same bulletproof Honda reliability. Going with a pre-2006 vehicle is still an option, but with a 17k budget I honestly don't see a reason to.

If you are in need of a bigger vehicle, then of course the accord is the way to go. If you are a car guy and speed is a priority than I would go with a V6 Accord or a Civic Si, depending on your budget/personal opinions.

5436,Honda,"CX is the lightest model and was the cheapest model.

No power steering. No power windows. AC was a dealer installed option. No bump strips. No passenger side mirror. Vinyl interior. No sway bars, not even a front one. And the engine is a 1.5 SOHC non-vtec 8 valve. No tach in the cluster. No cruise. Nothing. And some had an 8 gallon gas tank (all others had 10 or 12 I think). CXs also had no floor melt. That's something that was also left off of Integra Type Rs. Basically it's the factory version of Dynamatt. The CX Civic didn't come with it, so it is much louder inside than other models, but it also saved a few pounds of weight.

VX is basically a CX with a high gas mileage 16 valve E-VTEC engine. Still very light. They also had a ""diffuser"" under the driver side rear bumper, but it's basically just a fender liner like the front of the car has and doesn't do much and doesn't look like any kind of performance thing.

DX had power steering and AC and other options with a non-vtec 16 valve engine.

Si added a sunroof and a sportier interior and the SOHC vtec 16v engine.

No EG hatch came with a rear sway bar, but they're all about equally easy to add an Integra or aftermarket rear bar to. You need Integra lower arms or aftermarket to do it.

The CX and maybe the VX didn't come with a front bar, but either a Civic EX or Si or Integra bar will work. You'll need Integra arms. It's not too hard to do. Civics that came with front bars can be upgraded with an Integra front bar without swapping arms.

A B18B1 is an easy and cheap swap in any EG Civic. More power than the SI engine came with and probably easier to find. I have a B18B1 swapped CX with complete Integra GSR suspension and it was easy and cheap to build and a blast to drive and does alright on an autocross track. 

Integra brakes will swap onto any Civic pretty easily, but you'll need to order appropriate brake cables and upgrade to a '91 (EF body style) Civic EX mastercylinder - because the Integra master cylinder doesn't not bolt up to the Civic brake booster and the Integra brake booster won't fit on the Civic without extensive modification.

5465,Honda,"American trim differences (because I think the other commenter was referring to Canadian trims)

LX: Bluetooth. Back up camera. Cruise control. 4 speakers. Steel wheels. 5"" color infotainment screen. 1 USB, 1 AUX, 2 12V. Black trim on front and rear of car.

EX:  7"" touch screen infotainment system with pandora capability-- also shows current drive mileage and last 3 Trip A averages on screen. Lane watch. Fog lights. Nice looking alloys. Moon roof. 6 speakers (extra 20 watts I think). 2 usb, 1 hdmi, 1 12V. Cargo tie down hooks in floor of cargo area. Passive keyless entry (proximity fob). Push button start. Chrome (well, fake chrome) trim in front and rear of car.

Personally I went with the LX because most of the tech didn't interest me. Lane watch was distracting, the touch screen annoying to operate while driving. The only things I really wanted were the alloys and the moonroof, neither of which I was really able to justify the extra cost for. The LX is perfectly well equipped, and if you plan on keeping the car a long time, will mean fewer things that will potentially break. But the EX is definitely the more fun and exciting trim and you get a lot more for just $1800 extra. Test drive both, play with the features in the EX to see if they're worth it to YOU.

The CX (and maybe VX) are nice because they don't have power steering - so if you plan to do an engine swap that's one less system to try to integrate into the swap. That said, even the manual rack requires some arm muscles once you put wide sticky rubber on it.

If you start with an SI, then you've already got rear disks and the tach (and a sunroof), but SIs are harder to find.

Unless you live somewhere where EG hatches are coming out of the woodwork, I'd look more at the condition of individual cars you find for sale and get the straightest, least rusty body you can find and not worry about what model it is.

One thing that I know is really hard to swap onto a Civic that didn't come with it is cruise control. So if you want cruise control, look for a car that has cruise... although it might not be able to retain cruise on swap...

I personally like the CX for the simplicity and light weight. BUT the noisy interior at highway speed (due to the lack of floor melt) is a bit annoying.

Also beware that some of the CXs and VXs came with a blue interior that is pretty damn rare. You won't find many blue interior replacement parts in a junkyard.
