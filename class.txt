INSTRUCTOR BIO: 
Peter Figliozzi, Ph. D.
Pete is a professional data scientist.  He has used machine-learning algorithms to create predictive engines in variety of fields including marketing, mechanical prognostics and health management, and algorithmic stock trading.  Pete enjoys Codementoring and the great interaction and learning that comes with it.  Pete's degree is in Physics from the University of Texas, Austin.

INSTRUCTOR QUOTE:
"I'll show you how to use machine-learning to tackle real-world predictive analyses.  We'll start with industrial-strength data sets.  We'll break them down and understand them.  We'll see what commericially valuable models we can extract." 

WHO IS THIS CLASS FOR?
This class is for anyone who wants to learn how to apply machine-learning to real-world (commercial) problems.  All you'll need is a basic, working knowledge of Python.  No machine-learning experience is required.  

WHAT WILL YOU LEARN?
By the end of the class, you'll be able to: analyze a real-world, industrial-strength data set; explore that data set; formulate a comercially viable predictive question; and apply machine-learning algorithms to create a predictive engine.

Lesson 1: College Degrees
We'll use the U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard data set to predict what schools and degrees are worth the money.
 
Lesson 2: Jobs
We'll explore jobs and salaries data.  What fields are likely to grow or shrink in the future?  We will use this information to update our work from Lesson 1.

Lesson 3: Public Opinion
Using a full month of Reddit comments, we'll use some natural language processing (NLP) techniques to see what the public thinks about different companies and organizations.
 
Lesson 4: Mortality
We'll terminate our class after analyzing U.S. mortality rates.  We'll use this information to build a prediction engine that could be used to price insurance policies.
